<h1>Food For The Extinction</h1><p><i>The 6th great extinction is here. Climate collapse is unstoppable. Civilization can no longer support us. Research into resilient crops for food security in temperate climates. </i></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>A Path Forward</h2><p>Everyday I ask myself, what should I do? As our planet barrels towards an uninhabitable future, our governments become more repressive and everyday life becomes more dystopian, what can I do to stop all this? The most important realization, I think, is that none of us are going to change the world. We are not going to save the planet from another extinction (it's already happening). We are not going to save the billions of human and non-human lives that will perish. Already over 80 billion land animals are killed each year for consumption, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Words cannot do justice to the absolutely immense horrors we are responsible for. This is the nightmare you cannot wake up from. Clinging to some vision of a better future is tempting, but the evidence against this couldn't be more obvious. The destructive power of civilization, both physical and psychological, has been growing for thousands of years now. History has made it very clear time and time again - as a species we are not prepared to overcome this sociological phenomenon. And so we are perhaps one of the few generations of humans to live through the momentous shift climate collapse is causing. Nothing like this has ever happened in the entire history of humanity. Mankind is entering a new era.</p><p>In the face of all this, how can I be of any meaningful service? Why spend my time researching and growing food? I wish I could do more, believe me. I wish I could stop the murder, the torture, the enslavement, the destruction. But realistically, my influence will be quite limited. I believe having a relationship with nature is one of the most direct ways to feel satisfied, loved and empowered. And only individuals engaged with nature are capable of forming communities that truly provide for our physical, social and spiritual needs. When our empire inevitably collapses, these communities have the potential to be the building blocks of a new society, to form a federation of self-sufficient tribes. Keeping land at the forefront of both individual and societal success is an effective path forward because it is meaningful at every level - whether you just want to not hate the world, or you want to improve the living conditions of your community, or you want to build a new society. Even disregarding the bigger picture, this perspective is nothing but practical. How will you feed your family when industrial agriculture fails and supply chains fall apart? Growing food is a concrete way of solving a very real and imminent problem without depending on people who don't care about us or our planet. There's nothing glamorous about this, it's hands in the dirt kind of change, but it's real and it happens right before your eyes.</p><p>Growing your own food doesn't have to be hard, lots of vegetables even grow like weeds! Grass lawns were once a symbol of wealth, yet now they sit in front of even the most impoverished homes. This paradox was intentionally designed through generations of propaganda. For years I was utterly confused, why are some vegetables considered to grow too well and eradicated while right next door people go hungry? Is there an abundance of food or isn't there!? I will leave you to answer this yourself, but either way it certainly doesn't have to be like this. Only within the last few decades did we gain access to thousands of seeds from every corner of the earth. Consider how many generations of work went into finding, domesticating and improving these crops throughout human history! This is the most powerful gift our ancestors could have bestowed upon us, a privilege few could even dream of until now. I have a vision for a garden that uses the most resilient plants from every country, every culture, throughout history. A collection of food crops that has the power to save lives. </p><p>Stepping back from this fantasy for a moment, one of the primary goals of this research is to learn about underutilized food crops and then share these plants with those who need them. Most people have land with poor soil and very little knowledge about growing food. Finding crops that can grow in this environment and provide real sustenance is therefore of the utmost importance. The list of plants below is only what I have been looking into or trying to grow myself, it is not meant to be anything beyond that. Most should be of more general use but some are just of personal interest - you don't fall in love with plants without wanting to grow some of the less practical but rare/interesting/beautiful/threatened species. The list will be expanded and updated as I grow more plants and learn new things.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Nevertheless, a new breed of explorers has arisen, those who are disenchanted with the bland products of the supermarkets, those who still feel the primordial urge to plant, those whose tastes are adventurous. There are those whose pocketbooks are thin who can benefit from green leaves easily grown at home. Finally, there are the few who recognize that the vegetables we emphasize now are but a part of a larger, and mostly still available heritage, a heritage whose potentials have still not been fully realized.</i></p><p><i>- Edible Leaves Of The Tropics </i></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Working With Nature</h2><p>The methods I use all fit into a singular holistic approach - working with natural systems to incorporate food crops into the landscape. The plants are our teachers. This mean learning from them without any preconceived notions about how they should grow or what they should be doing. We are watching and listening, not expecting. It is absolutely essential that we approach this with a sense of humility, respect, and the recognition that plants are complex and intelligent living beings. We will never understand the endless layers of nuance that guide their growth, but lucky for us we don't need to. All we need to do is listen closely and offer our service.</p><p>Healthy soil is the backbone of temperate food forests, and plants are natural soil builders. Plants build soil using a few primary methods. Sending roots into the soil adds organic matter, cycles nutrients, aerates the soil and gives it structure. This builds soil from within. After the plants die, their stems and leaves fall over and act as mulch until they fully decompose. Dead plants keep the soil from drying out, return nutrients to the topsoil and offer a sheltered microclimate for everything happening at ground level. This builds soil from above. And the way plants naturally die and return to the ground creates a thick but not overly dense layer of mulch. Most importantly, it has structure. It allows space for other seeds to germinate and grow while still offering shelter from the elements. When one plant dies it creates the right environment for the next plant to take its spot, to work the soil with its roots, and then to become mulch for the next plant. This is the genius of nature. </p><p>So our two most important methods of building soil are using the power of roots to work the soil, and returning organic matter back to the topsoil as mulch. In the garden we can imitate these patterns by letting plants cover as much ground as possible. The more roots we have working the soil for us, the better. Of course, we can't let every single plant grow to maturity or else there would be no room for our food crops. This is where we come in. We can curate which plants to let grow and which to cut down. So instead of ripping everything up and dumping an even mat of mulch on our beds, we can build the soil more naturally. By cutting down plants in the garden and letting them fall over as mulch, we are imitating a natural soil-building pattern.</p><p>Practically, implementing this system is fairly straightforward because we are letting nature do most of the work for us. There will be a host of plants growing in our garden beds whether we like or not. If any plants are competing too much with our food crops, we just cut them down and let them fall where they are. The more aggressive the species is the more often those plants will need to be cut down. If we let them grow they may create too much shade or spread too aggressively. But the species that present little competition to our food crops need less management. Some of them may be edible themselves, some may attract beneficial insects, some may fix nitrogen, some may provide shelter. We are looking at the ground and seeing which plants are working for us and which ones aren't. Those that aren't get ripped up and now they are working for us as mulch! </p><p>As an example, in my garden beds I allow many plants to grow, some of which are: <i>Duchesnea indica [mock strawberry] </i>acts as a non-invasive groundcover;<i> Trifolium repens [white clover] </i>and any other leguminous plants fix nitrogen; <i>Lobelia inflata [Indian tobacco] </i>is a medicinal used by native american tribes; <i>Stellaria media [chickweed]</i> is a delicous edible; <i>Zinnia peruviana [Peruvian zinnia] </i>is a beautiful flower appreciated by local pollinators. There are also many that I rip up and mulch in place with as often as possible: <i>Muhlenbergia schreberi [nimblewill]</i> or any other weedy grasses spready quickly by rhizome and outcompete food crops; <i>Erechtites hieraciifolius [American burnweed], Acalypha rhomboidea [copperleaf], and Persicaria maculosa [lady's thumb] </i>all multiply rapidly by seed and can quickly take over garden beds. It is always helpful to watch how a plant interacts with the its environment before running to rip it up. Natural processes are constantly working towards a healthier ecosystem and are ultimately doing the vast majority of work for us. Our role is not to redefine these processes, but work with them to help shape the environment towards productivity and diversity. </p><p>This system works particularly well for beds with annuals and biennials that rely on seed dispersal for their continued survival. A thick layer of mulch would lock in moisture but prevent the dispersed seeds from germinating. A thin layer of mulch would allow the seeds to germinate but dry the soil out. But mulching in place with native plants creates a structured mulch that is thick enough to lock in moisture but fluffy enough to allow seeds to germinate. Seedlings are easily able to grow around whatever dead plants or garden debris fall around them. This system also allows us to work within a sustainable, closed loop. We are not depending on mulch or soil delivered from somewhere else, everything we need is being grown right on our own land. We are not importing fertility, we are building it.</p><p>Encouraging plants to cover the soil and continuously decompose has added benefits as well. First, it creates the right environment for insects. Bugs need a diverse landscape with a variety of physical niches to take advantage of. They don't like flat sheets of mulch. If we didn't have the right balance of insects, we would constantly be fighting against them. This method of management invites them all in to sort it out amongst themselves. The bugs can then become our partners as primary decomposers of dead plants, continuously adding fertility to the soil. Second, it creates the right environment for beneficial fungal networks. Plants depend on fungi to survive and thrive. The more roots they can partner with and the more organic matter we can feed them, the better. </p><p>Moving beyond building soil, we can also imitate how plants naturally disperse seed. Direct seeding right into the ground is effective and produces high germination rates, but there are drawbacks. If all the seedlings germinate at roughly the same time, they are all subject to identical conditions during identical phases of growth. If a dry spell occurs right after germination and the seedlings are not drought tolerant enough, they will all die unless they are watered. Or a slug may come through and eat them all. Or a bunny may walk on them. Or a heavy downpour may damage them. Or it may be too sunny and they'll get scorched. Any number of things could happen to affect them. But when seeds are naturally dispersed through whatever mechanism the plant uses, they tend to grow in slightly different circumstances. Many will not germinate at all, some will sit on a leaf until being knocked over a few months later, some will get moved around by the birds. Some will germinate and die because of the weather or because they landed in the wrong niche. Only a small percentage of them will grow to maturity - this is natural, and this is why plants produce so many seeds (hundreds or thousands). But even though the rate of germination is much lower, the resiliency of that population is much higher. So whenever possible we are imitating the natural dispersal of seeds and encouraging them to germinate intermittently in different conditions. This may be as simple as letting seeds drop of their own accord, but for me it often means tossing them around the garden beds and letting them grow on their own timeline. As an example, for plants in the <i>Brassicaceae</i> family, I usually leave the seeds in their pods, often still connected to one another, and just set them down on top of the mulch wherever I think they will grow well. Lucky for them I have legs! I can move their seeds around farther than they can, and I'm sure they would thank me for this if they could. For most annuals or biennials, the pattern is fairly similar: help the plant propogate itself without getting in the way. We are giving power back to the seeds by letting them decide when to germinate and how to grow - our job is only to create the right environment for them to do it.</p><p>For annuals or biennials this method requires a lot of seed. A single plant can produce thousands of seeds and only a small portion of those may grow to maturity in any given season. Unfortunately, many seed packets come with less than the amount of seeds a single plant would produce. So our first generation may need to be direct seeded in more carefully managed conditions (mild tempertures, good soil, access to water, little competition). This will get the plant acquainted with our local conditions while increasing our seed count to something more realistic. Once we have have hundreds or thousands of fresh seeds, these can then be dispersed more naturally into the garden beds. The soil is functioning as our seed bank - every year we are depositing more and more seeds into it that will then wait for the right opportunity to germinate and grow. With every successive generation, the plants will be better acclimated to this specific method and will grow more easily. And as the amount of seeds in the soil increases, we won't have to spend as much time weeding because our food crops will be able to cover more ground. </p><p>But even with the help we provide - weeding, mulching, managing beds, seed dispersal - some plants will simply not be suited for our soil or climate without a lot of work. So it's just as important to find the right species for our specific conditions. We can't expect to drop any old plant in and have it grow! This is why our plant selection prioritizes resiliency. And the amazing result of this method is that the plants that do succeed become stronger with every generation. Before long we will have a garden full of food that grows and propagates itself with relatively little effort. Of course, there will be regular maintenance like weeding and dispersing seed. Every garden requires maintenance (even mature food forests), but this method allows us to use natural processes to our advantage and intervene only when it is meaningful. This is not a step by step plan with a full proof outcome. This is a dance.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>The Plants We Eat</h2><p>How do we even begin to feed ourselves? What are we growing and eating? I personally do not grow nearly enough food to feed myself. It is a difficult task that most people throughout most of history have not attempted. Even after the advent of agriculture, a significant portion of food was often foraged from the local environment. But the natural abundance that once covered the earth has been almost completely destroyed. As agriculture evolved to power an ever-expanding civilization, forests were felled and landscapes were permanently disfigured. We burned down ecosystems masterfully designed over millenia, teeming with life and full of nutritious food, in an attempt to grow something a fraction as productive in their place, all with little human brains and big clumsy hands. The plants that sprouted in these graveyards were not grown for humans, but markets and masters; they could not nourish us in the same way. All this is only to say that growing all of our own food in a truly sustainable way requires a monumental effort and has not been the norm for most of human history. Still, we must do what we can with the current situation. Even growing only a portion of our food has enormous benefits and can certainly create some sense of food security even if it is not complete. So returning to our original question, what should we grow? What plants do people eat to survive? </p><p>The broadest pattern that emerges for practically any species on earth is that the foods that provide the most energy and nutrition (and are digestible by the specific anatomy of the creature) in any given landscape become primary sources of sustenance. That means a guerilla that has access to fruits will generally prioritize those over leaves. Eating 20 pounds of fruit is much easier than eating 20 pounds of leaves. And like many other animals, humans gravitate towards high-density sources of energy like nuts, fruits, roots and seeds to sustain themselves. Leafy vegetables, while an essential addition to our diet, require a much larger quantity to provide the same amount of energy. </p><p>This happens to work out quite well for us because nuts and fruits are some of the easiest, most productive perennial crops. Even with a limited amount of space we have many options, including hazlenut, plum and mulberry. Once planted, they can often continue producing for decades - talk about a return on investment! Tree crops also require significantly less resources to produce, meaning they will often tolerate poorer soil and less frequent watering than many herbacious crops. In this way they are extremely efficient at producing food. The benefits of trees are truly endless and there is no easier way to improve the health of a landscape. Fruit and nut trees are therefore the first priority for us and can make up a significant portion of our diet. </p><p>Root crops are also a very dense source of energy, often moreso than fruit. They usually require more work, however, as soil must be built up and the crops must be regularly propogated, either by seed or division. Cold-hardy, perennial root crops usually need at least 2 years of growth before harvest. This includes plants like groundnut and doraji. However, some can be harvested every year like the super-productive sunchoke. While perennial roots are more work than simply picking fruit off a tree, they usually require very little maintenence once planted. Annual roots may require better conditions to grow but can significantly expand our options with some heavy hitters like achira, taro and mashua. Alongisde nuts and fruits, roots are another significant addition to our diet. </p><p>Our next consideration is the smallest of the bunch: seeds, grains and pulses. When people grow all their own food, grains are usually how they do it. Grains are very calorically dense, easy to eat in quantity, and can be stored or transported easily. This is why almost every civilization on earth has been built on grains. But growing grain sustainably can be difficult - most often it results in a monoculture that continuously degrades the soil while providing very little ecological value. And to top it all off, grains require the most labor of any food mentioned here to grow, harvest and process. This is not to say they should be avoided, only that how they are grown and incorporated into our diet needs to be reconsidered. It may be useful to look into other sources of seeds like pollinator-friendly natives blue vervain and sunflower. Pulses are also valuable additions for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil and help other crops grow. Even so, this category of foods is generally comprised of labor-intensive annuals that provide little ecological benefit. Ultimately it may be useful to think of seeds, grains, and pulses as another addition to a varied diet, and not neccesarily the staple of every meal. </p><p>Finally, we arrive at leafy vegetables and the like. While they don't provide the bulk of our sustenenace, they are neccessary for vitamins and minerals (and flavor!). They also bring diversity and excitement to the garden. Here too we can focus on perennials that provide a crop every year with almost no effort after the initial planting. Plants like good king henry, turkish rocket and seombadi provide excellent vegetables that can easily be substituted for some of the more common foods you may be used to eating. Succulents like prickly pear or dolnamul can turn barren land with very little fertility into an oasis of fresh food. Plants that generate a lot of biomass like udo can offer us regular harvests while producing lots of organic matter for mulching. Weedy annuals like perilla can compete with grass and turn unproductive land into a thicket of food in a single season. The options are truly limitless, and every plant has its own uniqe traits that can be utilized to our advantage.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Methods</h2><p>The methods we use to plant, grow, maintain, harvest and propagate crops can make all the difference in both the health of the ecosystem and how much work it requires to maintain. I hope these will clarify and expand upon some of the points mentioned in the essays above.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Soil</b></h3><ul><li><b>Crops should feed us and the soil. </b>In a system without many outside inputs, generating our own mulch and regularly cycling nutrients through the soil are how we increase fertility. Crops that provide meaningful amounts of top growth make for great mulch. This includes plants like <i>Aralia cordata [udo] </i>and <i>Canna edulis [achira]. </i>Crops with fat roots help aerate our soil and feed beneficial bacteria when they decay. This includes plants like <i>Raphanus sativus [radish]</i> and <i>Brassica rapa [turnip]. </i>I like to follow a 50/50 rule for these taprooted plants - up to half get harvested, while the remaining are allowed to go to seed and decay back into the soil. Crops that fix nitrogen in the soil keep it healthy and productive. This includes plants like <i>Elaeagnus multiflora [goumi]</i> and <i>Phaseolus coccineus [runner bean]</i>. These should be incorporated in the garden as regularly as possible.</li><li><b>Imitate natural patterns. </b>Plants don't grow in neat rows, they grow dynamically among other plants, always sending out more seeds for the chance of finding new soil to grow in. Every generation is a new step forward in your relationship with them. Not only are our plants living through cycles, so is our mulch. A layer of dead leaves, grass and branches provide the right habitat for insects and continously improve the soil. Large logs are a massive source of fertility in the forest, and they work the same way in the garden too. Look out for leaves, grass clippings or branches in your neighborhood - these are better put to use in your garden then wherever they usually end up.</li><li><b>Build structure.</b> Loose soil gets compacted and washed away with heavy rains. Healthy soil has structure that improves drainage, aeration and water rention, all while holding it together and preventing erosion. I like to think of structure in both micro and macro terms. Micro-structure is what keep the indivdual soil particles together and allows them to act like a sponge - a valuable attribute of compost. Macro-structure is created by larger pathways that run through the soil, namely living or decaying roots that create channels for water, air and insects to travel. Surface roots of large trees can also physically hold topsoil in place by acting as a barrier and catching any runoff. Good soil has both micro and macro structure. In these cases, it may be difficult to dig into the topsoil due to the macro-structure of large roots getting in the way, even though the soil itself has excellent micro-structure as well. Tilling is avoided because it destroys soil structure and the fungal networks that depend on it. To take this even further, our mulch should have structure as well. I like to call it 'fluffy' mulch because it lets germinating seeds grow through it but still protects the soil and offers shelter to insects.</li></ul><h3><b>Design</b></h3><ul><li><b>Consider how it's harvested.</b> Some root crops like potatoes or sunchoke need to be dug up from the ground, disturbing the surrounding soil. Plant these alongside other root crops that get harvested at the same time or annuals that will be able to reseed themselves. Other plants like radishes, carrots or garlic can be harvested with little disturbance to surrounding plant life, allowing more flexibility for companion plants.. </li><li><b>Consider the scale.</b> Our approach to working in larger fields will be different than managing smaller garden beds. It is simply not practical to have the same attention to detail when covering larger spaces, so our focus shifts to thinking more broadly and simplifying patterns.</li><li><b>Use old shrubs and trees. </b>Vining plants evolved to climb on shrubs and trees, and so there couldn't possibly be a more perfect trellis. Woody plants also provide excellent mulch. If you don't need the space, find a way to use them to your advantage.</li></ul><h3>Resiliance</h3><ul><li><b>Challenge your plants.</b> Plants are like children: if you coddle them too much they will never grow up to be big and strong, but if you totally ignore them they may not survive. Allowing plants to acclimate to heavy competition and challenging growing conditions leads to a stronger population. By managaing the local environment we can help them develop resilient characteristics. </li><li><b>Plant for the long-term. </b>Whenever I introduce a new plant, I never expect to get a lot out of it right away. It takes time to understand the needs of a new species and develop a relationship with it. Perennials need a few years before really taking off while annuals often need a few generations to acclimate and self-select for the local conditions. Long-lived fruit and nut trees may take years to start producing but are the best investment you can make.</li><li><b>Build redundancy into crops.</b> Having the same plants in the same spot means they are all subject to the same conditions. I like to grow the same plant in different spots around the garden. This way if insects or wildlife find one, they may not find the other. Or if the weather affects one, it may not affect the other. Moving beyond the garden by planting food in our community, public spaces or wildneress areas (thoughtfully, of course) will provide further security and productivity. This is a cornerstone of resiliency. </li><li><b>Harvest rain water. </b>If you have a roof and a gutter system then most of the work is already done - congratulations! All you need to do is a purchase a few parts <a href="https://www.rainbrothers.com/store/DIY-Rain-Barrel-Kit-c73647286" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, and hook them up to some large barrels. Ideally you should be harvesting as much rainwater as possible in order to reduce reliance on water piped in from hundreds of miles away. If plants can't be grown with locally available water, you might want to think twice about growing them at all. And remember, good soil and mulch will make small amounts of water go ten times as far.</li></ul><h3>Plants</h3><ul><li><b>Judge plants for yourself.</b> Whether a plant is lowly famine food or an elite luxury is entirely made up. The food we eat says more about the whims of culture and the motives of civilization than it does about taste, nutrition or enjoyment. Many plants that were once important crops are now considered weeds!</li><li><b>Annuals are integral. </b>Some gardeners prefer to focus on perennial crops, allowing annuals to remain 'outside the system' in their own temporary beds. But annuals and biennials have useful qualities and can live right alongside many of our perennials. They fill an important niche due to their fast growth and often immense seed generation, allowing them to pop up after soil disturbance or fill in gaps between other crops. Ultimately, the soil should function as a seed bank - every season we are depositing thousands of seeds that will wait for the right opportunity to germinate and grow.</li></ul><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>What would it mean for us to come to terms with the knowledge that civilization, our whole mode of development and culture, has been premised and built upon extermination—on a history experienced as "terror without end" (to borrow a phrase from Adorno)? To dwell on such a thought would be to throw into almost unbearable relief the distance between our narratives of inherent human dignity and grace and moral superiority, on the one hand, and the most elemental facts of our actual social existence, on the other. </i></p><p><i>We congratulate ourselves for our social progress—for democratic governance and state-protected civil and human rights (however notional or incompletely defended)—yet continue to enslave and kill millions of sensitive creatures who in many biological, hence emotional and cognitive particulars resemble us. To truly meditate on such a contradiction is to comprehend our self-understanding to be not merely flawed, but comically delusional.</i></p><p><i>In the nineteenth century, the animal welfare advocate Edward Maitland warned that our destruction of other animals lead only to our own "debasement and degradation of character" as a species. "For the principles of Humanity cannot be renounced with impunity; but their renunciation, if persisted in, involves inevitably the forfeiture of humanity itself. And to cease through such forfeiture man is to become demon." What else indeed can we call a being but demon who routinely enslaves and kills thousands of millions of other gentle beings, imprisons them in laboratories, electrocutes or poisons or radiates or drowns them?</i></p><p><i>-John Sanbonmatsu</i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Favorite Crops 🖤</h2><p>These are the crops I believe can form the foundation of a resilient and productive garden. This is based on a few different criteria: how easy they are to grow and use, how drought tolerant they are, their nutritional and medicinal qualities, how much organic matter they generate, and how productive they are.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Vegetables</h3><ul><li><b>Aralia Cordata 'Udo' (Perennial):</b> Edible young leaves and stem on a productive die-back bush.</li><li><b>Bunias Orientalis 'Turkish Rocket' (Perennial):</b> A perennial mustard, flowers every year and eaten like rapini.</li><li><b>Chenopodium Bonus-Henricus 'Good King Henry' (Perennial): </b>Choice flower heads and spinach-like leaves.</li><li><b>Dystaenia Takesimana 'Seombadi' (Perennial):</b> Stalks and leaves provide an excellent alternative to celery.</li><li><b>Opuntia Humifosa 'Prickly Pear' (Perennial):</b> Cold hardy cactus for poor soil, both pads and fruit can be eaten.</li><li><b>Perilla Frutescens 'Perilla' (Annual): </b>Green varieties are used as a vegetable and can be grown in quantity.</li></ul><h3>Onions</h3><ul><li><b>Allium Cepa Proliferum 'Walking Onion' (Perennial):</b> One of the easiest onions to grow, used like scallions. </li><li><b>Allium Hookier 'Hooker's Onion' (Perennial):</b> Small bulbs and leaves, another easy onion.</li><li><b>Allium Sativum 'Garlic' (Perennial):</b> Grown as a perennial, garlic is straightforward and reliable.</li></ul><h3>Roots</h3><ul><li><b>Apios Americana 'Groundnut' (Perennial):</b> Small tubers are easy to harvest, full of protein, and simple to cook. </li><li><b>Canna Edulis 'Achira' (Annual): </b>Peruvian root crop with large tropical leaves and sweet rhizomes.</li><li><b>Colocasia Esculenta 'Taro' (Annual)</b>: Some varieties mature in under 6 months, growing in shady and wet locations.</li><li><b>Helianthus Tuberosus 'Sunchoke' (Perennial):</b> Grows anywhere in sun and produces heavily without any work.</li><li><b>Lycopus Lucidus 'Chinese Bugleweed' (Perennial):</b> Small juicy tubers on a plant that grows like a weed.</li><li><b>Platycodon Grandiflorus 'Doraji' (Perennial): </b>Traditional Korean root crop, growing larger every year until harvest. </li><li><b>Solanum Ajanhuiri 'Potato' (Annual): </b>A potato species from Peru known for its frost resistance. </li><li><b>Tropaeolum Tuberosum 'Mashua' (Annual):</b> Another Andean root crop, forming tubers in short days of fall.</li></ul><h3>Fruit/Trees</h3><ul><li><b>Actinidia Arguta 'Hardy Kiwi' (Perennial): </b>The vigorous and hardy cousin to the kiwi with small, hairless fruit.</li><li><b>Corylus Americana 'American Hazelnut' (Perennial):</b> A native nut tree small enough for the backyard.</li><li><b>Elaeagnus Multiflora 'Goumi' (Perennial):</b> A great support tree with edible berries that fixes nitrogen.</li><li><b>Ficus Carica 'Fig' (Perennial): </b>Will grow anywhere there is sun and very simply to propogate.</li><li><b>Morus Nigra 'Mulberry' (Perennial):</b> Dwarf varieties are perfect for smaller spaces, berries produced in quantity.</li><li><b>Prunus Americana 'Plum' (Perennial):</b> Native, easy to grow and loaded with plums.</li></ul><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Polycultures</h2><p>The following are experimental group plantings I am testing. I find polycultures most useful for root crops as they often require regular soil disturbance and replanting, whereas many other vegetables can usually grow alongside each other without much trouble.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><b>Sunchoke + Crosne:</b> I beleive this polyculture came from Eric Toensmeier although I don't remember. The crosne stays low to the ground while the sunchoke shoots up super high. Both can be harvested at the end of fall and replanted right away to overwinter. Moderate soil, sun.</li><li><b>Deodeok + Chinese Bugleweed:</b>  The chinese buglweed branches out nicely, grows over 5 feet tall and provides a trellis for the deodeok vines. This pairing should be harvested every 2-3 years so the deodeok has time to fatten up. Deodeok has a taproot while Chinese buglweed has shallow tubers, so they shouldn't interfere with one another. Moderate soil, part shade to sun.</li><li><b>Marshmallow + Groundnut:</b> Similar thinking to the polyculture above, one shallow root and one taproot, both harvested every 2-3 years. The marshmallow should be started from division so the first year it will grow tall enough to support the groundnut. Moderate soil, part shade to sun.</li><li><b>Achira + Taro + Mashua: </b>This is a primetime polyculture I use in the best spot in the garden that stays moist year round and gets lots of sun. The achira gets tall enough to provide some shade and shelter for the others, while the mashua is allowed to sprawl on the ground and climb around. All get harvested at the end of fall and then brought indoors to overwinter. Produces a lot of mulch that can be applied back to the same spot once harvested. Moist and rich soil, sun.</li><li><b>Prickly Pear + Dolnamul:</b> A basic pairing, both vegetables thriving in similar conditions, dolanmul acting as a groundcover for prickly pear. The only issue is that prickly pear has glochids, so I would avoid harvesting the dolnamul directly next to the cactus pads just in case they got knocked off. You do not want to eat a glochid! Poor or well-draining soil, sun.</li><li><b>Udo + Hosta + Jiaogulan: </b>Three excellent vegetables that can grow in shade. Udo acts as the centerpiece and trellis for jiaogulan, while a few hostas serves as the groundcover around it. My only concern is that after a few years the jiaogulan would get too aggressive and shade out the udo, although this would likely be easy to manage. Hosta gets harvested as shoots in spring, the other two are harvested as needed. Moderate soil, shade to part shade.</li></ul><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Man, do not pride yourself on your superiority to the animals, for they are without sin, while you, with all your greatness, you defile the earth wherever you appear and leave an ignoble trail behind you -- and that is true, alas, for almost every one of us!</i></p><p><i>-Fyodor Dostoyevsky</i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Guide</h2><p><b>Annual/Perennial: </b>Designations for zone 7, may differ in other climates. I typically try to use the most common English name for the plant, although the Latin name is always the most accurate. I also sometimes include the name of the plant in the most relevant language to help with personal research.</p><p><b>Edible:</b> Useful edible parts. Not comprehensive, not a reference, only a starting point. Often there will be more edible portions than indicated, but I may not mention them for any number of reasons. Do not eat anything you are not 100% familiar with. Always be certain of your identification and the parts edible. Consult multiple sources, see resources above. </p><p><u>Root:</u> Plants that store energy in roots or tubers usually draw on this energy to produce flowering shoots. Perennial roots are therefore usually harvested after the plant has flowered and been given ample time to store more energy in the roots. This may be at the end of the growing season or it may be earlier. Annual roots are harvested before flowering as in this case it signifies the end of the plant's life. This is often at the end of spring or fall depending on when it was planted and the lifespan of the plant, but may be any time of year. After flowering occurs the root will be tough and inedible. However, whether annual or perennial the best practices for harvesting will depend on the specific plant and growing conditions.</p><p><u>Shoot:</u> Shoot refers only to the young growth of the plant when it first emerges from the ground (i.e., the entire aerial portion of the young plant, often in spring). How large the young plant is when harvested depends on the specific plant. Just because a shoot is edible does not indicate that any part of the mature plants is edible - if a plant contains harmful or toxic substances, these may be in low enough quantities when the plant is young but not when it matures. If the mature leaves of a plant are edible then usually so is the shoot, but depending on the plant I may not write this if it is not normally eaten that way (as in the case with many herbs). Shoots are valued for their sweet flavor and tender texture, especially when the mature plant may be bitter or tough. They are therefore often the preferred harvest of a plant.</p><p><u>Stem &amp; Leaf:</u> If the leaf is edible then usually so is the tender new growth, harvested with some of the new stem. In fact, when the leaves are small, young or tightly bunched, this can often be the best time to harvest. I only indicate separately that the stem is edible when it constitutes a meaningful portion of the edible harvest or when it can be eaten even when relatively mature. For example, amaranth or nettle are often eaten with some of the tender stem, but I only write the leaf is edible because the stem is relatively insignificant to the harvest. However, when water spinach, angelica, udo and many others are harvested, the stem is cut further down and constitutes a significant part of the vegetable, therefore it is included in the edible portions. Of course this is not always a clear line as it varies between plants and how you choose to harvest or prepare them.</p><p><u>Inflorescence:</u> Flowering shoots are a separate identification and these are indicated as inflorescence. These are eaten when still young, clustered, unopened and tender. If the inflorescence is edible then often so are the flower buds and flowers, although this may not always be practical or palatable. There are roughly three stages for harvest: entire young inflorescence while still tender, sometimes with some of the tender stem attached; the individual, unopened flower buds picked off once the flowering stem becomes tougher; the blooming flowers when fully or partially open. Some plants are only eaten during one stage, while some can be eaten during all three. Once a plant begins to form a flowering shoot, the leaves usually become more bitter and tough as energy is being drawn away to support the flowers.</p><p><u>Seed:</u> I will occasionally indicate the seed is edible if it is useful in some way. Just because a flower is edible does not mean the seed is, and vice versa.</p><p>Some of the plants are marked as calorie crops. This is to indicate they are efficient producers of calories given one season and a limited amount of space. This is entirely root and seed crops. It does not include many other useful and potential staple crops that take longer to grow or are not as efficient.</p><p>The best way to know how to eat a plant is to do research, grow it and become familiar with it. Even with references, the actual details of how it's harvested and eaten can vary between plants. And keep in mind that many online references are just summarizing (often poorly or incorrectly) physical reference books that provide more detail. If a plant is uncommon, then especially thorough research is required. Typically we are looking to answer a few basic questions. Is there an extensive history of humans eating this part of the plant? If so, how is it prepared and in what quantities is it eaten? Are there any indications that this plant may contain harmful or toxic substances? The more information you have, the better.<i> </i>Just because one species in a genus is edible does not mean that other species are. Just because one part of the plant is edible does not mean that others parts are. These kinds of assumptions will put you in the hospital or in the ground. And just because a plant can be eaten without any noticeable adverse effects does not mean that it is safe to eat regularly over a longer period of time. This is why we study how plants have historically been eaten.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Useful methods of propagation. Usually seed, stem cutting, or rhizome/tuber/root division. Seeds that prefer cold stratification or sunlight to germinate are often noted as such. I usually try to get bare roots or potted plants if a seed is difficult to germinate.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Rough guidelines for minimum sun requirements: Sun (≈90-100%) → Part Shade (≈60-90%) → Shade (≈30-60%) → Deep shade (≈0-30%). Estimating sun is difficult, but I do my best to give rough guidelines. Most of the time, if a plant prefers shade, it will also prefer rich and moist soil. And keep in mind that just because a plants prefers sun doesn't mean it can handle the scorching heat summer often brings. This is often true for plants that grow naturally in cooler climates, such as in high altitudes or in coastal areas. Some plants have markers that indicate they grow easily or self-sow, these are great plants to start with.</p><p><b>Wildlife:</b> Impact of wildlife and insects on plant. We have lots of deer as well as chipmunks, rabbits and birds that live nearby. I try to grow enough food for everyone, but I can't let them eat everything! I have some fenced areas for sensitive plants I don't want being bothered. I try to be as hands-off as possible and rarely remove insects from plants or interfere with their growth. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Everything else. Observations about growth habits, useful varieties, hardiness, harvesting, interactions with other plants and more. Plants with photos were grown in Maryland, roughly zone 7a. You may notice some of the plants in my photos don't look perfectly healthy - this is okay. If it is a perennial, as long as it has a healthy root system it will grow just fine after being planted and given a few seasons to adjust. The conditions are fairly wet year round, although in the summer there are stretches where the soil dries out. Soil is good overall, some spots with heavy clay and some very sandy. Normally the only time I water plants is while they are getting established. Most non-perennial plants survive (or die) exclusively on rain water, unless they are lucky enough to be near a perennial I'm watering. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Herbs</h2><p><br></p><h3>Agastache Rugosa 'Korean Mint' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.

Some varieties are bushier while some prefer to climb. There can be big differences in root size between varieties, make sure to get an improved variety. Small harvest after one season or leave in ground for as long as you want so tubers can grow larger. Probably best on a 2-3 year rotation, similar to other perennial root crops. Nitrogen fixer, but since the root is harvested it's unlikely to benefit the soil as much as other fixers. </p><p>As far as food forests go, I am interested in this species as being able to grow around other plants in partial shade and climb on other crops. Production will be lower this way but it serves a niche that few other root crops are able to. When weeding around it care must be taken as the vine climbs on any plants around it. Other species within this genus may also be useful but there is very little information available.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/lhp9badujuf1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A. americana.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Arctium Lappa 'Burdock' | Biennial ⚫</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">CALORIE CROP</b></p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.

I collect the seed pods from plants left to flower and just toss them around the beds. They come back up reliably and seem more resilient than other mustards, especially for summer-growth. Plus they are super easy to overwinter, so they basically grow year round. It can also just be harvested for the leaves, allowing the root to stay in the ground and improve the soil. This is an excellent practice because it feeds you and feeds the soil at the same time, concentrating sugars in the topsoil. It won't penetrate and aerate the soil as well as the radish but has more useful leaves and is easier to grow. Overwintered plants can produce a significant amount of greens.

Most do not reliably overwinter below Z8. In colder areas, bring the corms indoors over winter and store them in a cool, dry medium (same as you would a canna rhizome). They are better producers when annually harvested and separated. They prefer sun but will tolerate a good amount of shade. The more water they have the better, but are fine with normal garden conditions as well.</p><p>Taro is a plant that you need to be familiar with how each specific variety is eaten. With varieties like Tsurunoko or Miyako, the main corm is too acrid but the dormant cormels are the main crop. Others are used for the main corm, and some others may be used only for the leaves. Corms are formed continuously as the plants grows, so even if it doesn't reach maturity you may still get something out of it. If not for eating at least to replant next season.</p><p><b>C. gigantea</b> is used only for its leaf stems, the corm is not eaten. The leaf stems are an excellent vegetable, great for soup and produced in quantity, known as Bac Ha. Many references indicate they need to be peeled, although I believe this may only apply to the older and tougher stems. I have eaten tender stems without peeling and they have been very pleasant. Some clones such as 'Thailand Giant' or similar ones sold in nurseries are not used for food and are less hardy. However the common variety used for food can be found on ebay or etsy. This species seems tougher than taro, I believe it is less domesticated. Spreads by stolon, so after a season of growth it will start to form patches. </p><p>Given the large leaves and how vigorously this plant grows, it is also a good mulch plant. This species overwinters in my climate with no protection, even with relatively wet soil, sprouting in late June. I imagine it could overwinter even in colder areas (I have seen reports of it overwintering in Z6). However it gets off to a very slow start when grown as a perennial in this climate, and the fact that is sprouts only when rain is becoming infrequent doesn't help either. Will tolerate fairly deep shade but prefers sun.</p><p>Plants in this genus are very closely related to those in the Alocasia genus, some of which are used as food as well. Bac Ha is often incorrectly identified as coming from this genus (even in a reference book I have). I don't think any Alocasia species are cultivated for food in temperate climates.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/ucu1cic20gcn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. esculenta.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/qln6efh76csm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. gigantea.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Crepidiastrum Sonchifolium 'Goddeulbbaegi' '고들빼기' | Biennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Uncommon, bitter vegetable in the daisy family.

The old name is<b> D. opposita</b>. Most yams are only grown in the tropics (or grown as annuals), but this species is particularly cold hardy. Aerial tubers can spread and propagate themselves, best planted in a spot where it cannot escape and where management is easy. Roots are fragile, should be grown in bag/tube/barrel that can be easily dug up without disturbing root. Plastic drainage pipes are used as well. Root takes about 2-3 years to harvest, aerial tubers are good crop until then. If growing for aerial tuber crop, best to set aside some roots to leave in ground indefinitely, as older roots will produce more and larger aerial tubers. Needs a large trellis to climb on. When planting aerial tubers, be aware they may take weeks or months to send up leaves. It's a great plant but given that it's difficult to harvest straight out of the ground and that it can spread rapidly by bulbils makes it more annoying to grow than other perennials. Once you have a good setup in a good spot it's no problem though.</p><p>The book <i>Ethnobotany and Useful Resource Plants of Dokdo and Ulleung Island in Korea</i> indicates that the young leaves and tender new growth of this particular species can be eaten after being cooked.

Once established it can shade out weeds and aerate soil with tubers, making it useful for revitalizing soil. The only issue is removing it when you are ready to plant something else - the plants should be cut down once they are close to maturity mid-season, right before flowering.

Because of deer pressure I grow most of my potatoes in a fenced area. The goal is to harvest them in the fall once their foliage dies back, and then immediately replant them to stay in the ground over winter.

Domestication has made potatoes larger, more stationary, and more edible but has also weakened their resistances. </p><p>Potato species that retain some of these resistances should be able to be grown in a more perennial way. I think this species, sometimes called ajawiri, should be an excellent choice. <b>S. curtilobum</b> may also be a good option, a beautiful purple potato although it only forms tubers during short days in fall. <b>S. tuberosum </b>is the standard domesticated species, and often suffers from pests and disease. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/v5e6s0f6ivue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Solanum spp.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Stachys Affinis 'Crosne' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.

Some pests.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established - multiple varieties.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to propagate via bulbs. You can plant the aerial bulbets, although they will take longer to produce a good crop and easily get lost in the garden. Varieties originally collected growing in the wild may have interesting qualities. Scapes and leaves make for good vegetables as well. Garlic only grows well and forms good bulbs in cooler weather - this is why it is planted in the fall and harvested the following summer. Once the temperatures warm up the plant will stop growing and start to dry out. If the conditions are right this will lead to a regular head of garlic that has excellent storage properties. </p><p>I am primarily interested in growing garlic as a perennial, leaving it in the ground as it goes dormant over the summer. This means the clove will turn into a bulb after one season, and then this bulb will become many cloves, and they will continue multiplying in this way. This forms a garlic clump that will produce small wet bulbs, leaves and scapes in quantity. These are all crops in their own right. At any point you can divide the clump and plant out individual bulbs to start new patches. This is easier than growing it as an annual because there is no need to worry about getting the right conditions for proper storage bulb formation. I don't like weeding or watering if I don't have to, so why not grow it as a perennial? The downside is that there is no crop that can be stored for very long. I like fermenting garlic to make it last logner. However there is no reason you cannot also grow it as an annual in addition to the perennial patches if it is important to have storage bulbs.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/qualr1ll231v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A. sativum.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Tricoccum 'Ramp' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, seed.

This species, a hot pepper, is a perennial in warmer climates but could be grown in a pot and brought indoors during the winter. There are a few different varieties, mainly separated by color - red, orange and yellow. Oikos Tree Crops (a now closed nursery) suggested a yellow variety was best for overwintering indoors due to its tolerance for less light. This is the seed I purchased but I can't verify that as of yet. If a scheme can be worked out to overwinter this plant, then it is valuable as a way to have a high yield of large hot peppers every year with very little effort. The main stem starts to get woody after a few months of growth. Like other peppers, if growing indoors or in a greenhouse it may need to be hand-pollinated. I have seen ants in the flowers, I believe they are pollinating the plants for me. Growing hot peppers is useful for preserving vegetables. </p><p><b>C. flexuosum</b> is a hot pepper with tiny fruits that is the hardiest of all species, possibly even to my area.

Still, it seems to be the most approachable and the shoots alone can provide a good quantity of vegetables.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/uosa8f4p69bq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">D. takesimana.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Galinsoga Parviflora 'Gallant Soldier' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, stem, leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">SELF SOWS</b></p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Entire plant eaten when still young.

There are two general types - one with smaller, serated leaves and another with larger, more tender leaves. Easy to get established and should self-seed. Just toss the seeds around on exposed or disturbed soil. The germination has been excellent and they have proven to be resilient to dry soil as well. Overall a very easy vegetable to cultivate. While it will grow in dry soil and full sun, it may bolt too soon for harvest in stressful conditions. Better suited as a fall crop, but even if growing in spring/summer it will go to seed and produce a successive crop for the fall anyway. <i>Useful Plants Of Japan, Described And Illustrated </i>indicates this plant was sown in the fall and overwintered, however in my region it does not overwinter. When eaten as a vegetable it is cooked. <i>A Dictionary Of Japanese Food</i> writes that the raw leaves and small flowers are used as a garnish. </p><p><b>C. nankingense</b> is cultivated in China and eaten the same way. <b>C. morifolium</b> has a variety 'Abokyu' cultivated in Japan for its large edible flowers.

Very fragrant. Many others, although the few that can be eaten as vegetables as opposed to just garnishes/teas stand out as excellent crops because of how easily this genus grows and reseeds itself.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/cljhku5tit6t" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">G. coronaria.</a></p><h3><br></h3><h3>Gynostemma Pentaphyllum 'Jiaogulan' '绞股蓝' | Perennial ⚫</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Shade to part shade. Woodland.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Good leafy vegetable for shady spots or thickets, great potential for food forest. In my mind vines are one of the trickiest elements to really incorporate in temperate climates - many fruit vines must be trained up something and would smother shrubs or trees if planted below them. Perennial vines with edible leaves are also rare in temperate climates. Fortunately this checks all the boxes, dying back every year and happy to sprawl wherever it can. So even if you already have a nice shady plant setup, this can just be planted nearby and will instantly add another layer of food and another layer of diversity. Older specimens still have the potential to smother shrubs but can be cut back easily.</p><p>Most reports discuss the medicinal benefits of drinking as a tea, but the leaves can also just be eaten like a vegetable after being cooked. Not very cold hardy and takes time to get going after winter in my climate. Need a male and female to produce viable seed. I have some planted by shrubs I don't need and some are just left to sprawl. Looks somewhat similar to virginia creeper but jiaogulan has visible leaf petioles and leaf hairs, as well as a different arrangement of leaflets.

They are cooked, dried, pickled, or sometimes eaten raw. The flowers are sweet, tasty and produced in quantity. Some of the best tasting flowers. Shoots or very young leaves are occasionally cooked as vegetables as well, leaves quickly get tough. <i>Edible Wild Plants Of Vietnam</i> indicates the roots of at least one species used for edible flowers has mildly poisonous roots. Granted this book isn't the most reliable but it's worth noting. <i>The Encyclopedia Of Edible Plants Of North America </i>mentions the roots are eaten<i> </i>but <i>Food Plants Of</i> <i>China</i> makes no mention of it for any of the species. It is possible only certain species are used for the root. I am personally not very interested in eating them either way.

It can be direct seeded into a compacted lawn and grow just fine without irrigiation (in my climate), without any weeding, competing well with grass. This is a rare and valuable quality. It is an efficient producer of biomass, the thick stems of a mature plant make great mulch. The leaves are a protien-rich vegetable and just a few plants will provide a good quantity of leaves. The height of the plants makes them a natural companion for vining edibles, such as pole beans. The structure of the plant also creates very little shade provided they are not planted too densley, allowing them to be grown in garden beds and add a layer of vertical height without shading out other crops. <b>H. sabdariffa</b> is the standard for using as a vegetable, however, and grows much smaller.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/n4p0ji80ca8j" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">H. cannabinum.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Hordeum Vulgare 'Barley' | Annual </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Seed. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">CALORIE CROP</b></p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>This is one of the easiest grains to grow, particularly well suited for dry soil.

There are many hulless varieties that are easy to process at home. <a href="https://greatlakesstapleseeds.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Great Lake Staple Seeds</a> has a good selection. The best barley harvests will come from cool weather, and this has the added benefit of more moisture in the soil. Spring barley can be dispersed at the end of winter when the ground starts to thaw. </p><p>Barley will mature in about 2-3 months and the seed heads should be allowed to dry out on the stalk. Once they are brown and brittle, collect them. For small amounts, hulless varieties can be rolled through your hands to loosen the seed. For larger amounts, they can be placed in a bowl or bucket and mashed with a stick, mortar and pestle style. Or they can be beaten with a stick on a tarp. Once the hulls are removed they can then be winnowed by pouring from bucket to bucket next to a fan or on a windy day.</p><p>It can be planted alongside clover or other nitrogen-fixing crops to keep the soil healthy. It can even be grown in a patch of grass with some results. Mow the area as close to the ground as you can, disperse the barley along with any companion plants (like clover), and then cover with the mowed grass. This pattern works for barley because it does fine in poor soil with a lot of competition. Other grains seem to require better conditions or more mangement.</p><p><br></p><h3>Sorghum Bicolor 'Sorghum' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Seed. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">CALORIE CROP</b></p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.

A worthwhile attempt would involve grafting it to Trifoliate rootstock and growing it out in a pot for a few years, sheltering it during winter until transplant to a good location. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/jh64lvcop18l" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">P. trifoliata.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Prunus A<b>mericana</b> 'Plum' | Perennial 🖤</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Fruit.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, cutting.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established + beach plum, chinese apricot, and red/white nanking cherry.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>One of the easiest fruits for North America.

Tons of options within this genus. This species is the classic red raspberry bush. It has a perennial root system that send up new canes every year, but each cane only fruits the second year before dying. Everbearing varieties will fruit twice before the canes die. The thimbleberry, <b>R. parviflorus</b>, barely fruits at all but doesn't have any thorns, grows taller and the canes live longer and continue producing. The Japanese wineberry, <b>R. phoenicolasius</b>, is an extremely thorny scrambling bush although it can be trellised. <b>R. fruticosus</b> is the blackberry. Of all the cane types in this genus I think thornless raspberries are the easiest to manage. There are also groundcovers with modest fruiting like <b>R. calycinoides</b>, the Taiwanese creeping raspberry. It is small and not the most productive crop but covers ground well and grows very easily. <b>R. nepalensis</b>, the Nepalese raspberry,<b> </b>is also a ground cover but with larger fruits. This one is less common but worth more testing. Most are fairly aggressive growers in this climate.

Lowbush is the cold hardy wild form that is a smaller plant with smaller berries. Highbush is the cultivated form, a bigger plant with bigger berries and better heat tolerance. There are hybrids as well. This species is the most common but there are many other worthwhile species in this genus. All need acidic soil, growing naturally in acidic forest soil, so may not be the easiest plant for the backyard garden without some preparation. However, I think that making sure there is a lot of organic matter in/on the soil is often good enough. Place it in a spot with rich soil and mulch it heavily with garden debris. I am growing the 'Hardyblue' variety. I am also attempting to grow <b>V. gaultheriifolium</b>, the chinese blueberry.

Both fruit and pads have spines that must be removed, as well as invisible barbed hairs called glochids that are painful to the touch. Harvest with gloves or tongs and then thoroughly burn or scrub the entire pad. <b>O. cacanapa</b> is a bit less cold hardy but has larger pads. For the sake of science I rubbed my hands on this one and it does definitely have glochids as well. <b>O. stricta</b> should also be suitable for cold winters. The amount of spines differs between species and which form you have. Many species have spineless varieties (they all likely still have glochids though).
