Wild potatoes do not suffer from these problems because they are often resistant to both disease and frost, but many wild potatoes are either not safe to eat and/or difficult to harvest. Wild potatoes are also able to spread multiple feet each year via tubers attached to long stolons, allowing them to move around as they grow. Domestication has made potaotes more stationary and more edible but has also weakened their resistances. Finding domesticated species that maintain some of their wild genetics while still being easy to harvest and edible seems to be the best way to incorporate perennial potato patches into forest gardens. Allowing the tubers to move around the garden will also likely significantly improve disease resistance, as they won't be stuck in the same patch of soil year after year. Some species form tubers during short days in fall and some are day-neutral. Short day potatoes are less productive and have a limited harvest window, but for those same reasons may also be less prone to wildlife interference. </p><p><br></p><h3>Oxalis Tuberosa (Oca) | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber, leaf, stem.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.
