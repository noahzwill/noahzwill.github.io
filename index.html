<h1>Crop Research </h1><hr><p><br></p><p>The 6th great extinction is here. Climate collapse is unstoppable. Civilization can no longer support us. Research into resilient crops for food security in temperate climates. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Philosophy</h2><p><br></p><p>Everyday I ask myself, what should I do? As our planet barrels towards an uninhabitable future and our governments become more repressive, what can I do to stop all this? The most important realization, I think, is that none of us are going to change the world. We are not going to save the planet from another extinction (it's already happening). We are not going to save the billions of human and non-human lives that will perish. Already over 80 billion land animals are killed each year for consumption, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Words cannot do justice to the absolutely immense horrors we are responsible for. This is the nightmare you cannot wake up from. Clinging to some vision of a better future is tempting, but the transformation towards an ecological socialist utopia is exactly that, a utopia. It's simply not going to happen within our lifetimes, or likely ever. The destructive power of civilization, both physical and psychological, has been growing for thousands of years now. History has made it very clear time and time again - as a species we are not prepared to overcome this sociological phenomenon. And so we are perhaps one of the few generations of humans to live through the momentous shift climate collapse is causing. Nothing like this has ever happened in the entire history of humanity. It is frightening, to say the least.</p><p>In the face of all this, how can I be of any meaningful service? Why spend my time researching and growing food? I wish I could do more, believe me. I wish I could stop the murder, the torture, the enslavement, the destruction. But realistically, my influence will be quite limited. I believe having a relationship with nature is one of the easiest and most direct ways to feel satisfied, loved and empowered. And only individuals engaged with nature are capable of forming communities that truly provide for our physical, social and spiritual needs. When our empire inevitably collapses, these communities have the potential to be the building blocks of a new society, to form a federation of self-sufficient tribes. Keeping land at the forefront of both individual and societal success is an effective path forward because it is meaningful at every level - whether you just want to not hate the world, or you want to improve the living conditions of your community, or you want to build a new society. This perspective is nothing but practical. How will you feed your family when industrial agriculture fails and supply chains fall apart? Growing food is a concrete way of solving a very real and imminent problem without depending on people who don't care about us or our planet. There's nothing glamorous about this, it's hands in the dirt kind of change, but it's real and it happens right before your eyes.</p><p>Growing your own food doesn't have to be hard, lots of vegetables even grow like weeds! Grass lawns were once a symbol of wealth, yet now they sit in front of even the most impoverished homes. This paradox was intentionally designed through generations of propaganda. I am trying to find an easy way out, a way for anyone to grow lots of food and medicine on whatever land they have access to. Only within the last few decades did we gain access to thousands of seeds from every corner of the earth. Consider how many generations of work went into finding, domesticating and improving these crops throughout human history! This is the most powerful gift our ancestors could have bestowed upon us, a privilege few could even dream of until now. I have a vision for a garden that uses the most resilient food crops from every country, every culture, throughout history. </p><p>Stepping back from this fantasy for a moment, one of the primary goals of this research is to learn about underutilized food crops and then share these plants with those who need them. Most people have land with poor soil and very little knowledge about growing food. Finding crops that can grow in this environment and provide real sustenance is therefore of the utmost importance. These crops, along with nothing more than locally available materials, can then be used to transition the land to a diverse and productive ecosystem. </p><p>The list of plants below is only what I have been looking into or trying to grow myself, it is not meant to be anything beyond that. Most should be of more general use but some are just of personal interest - you don't fall in love with plants without wanting to grow some of the less practical but rare/interesting/beautiful/threatened species. The list will be expanded and updated as I grow more plants and learn new things.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Nevertheless, a new breed of explorers has arisen, those who are disenchanted with the bland products of the supermarkets, those who still feel the primordial urge to plant, those whose tastes are adventurous. There are those whose pocketbooks are thin who can benefit from green leaves easily grown at home. Finally, there are the few who recognize that the vegetables we emphasize now are but a part of a larger, and mostly still available heritage, a heritage whose potentials have still not been fully realized.</i></p><p><i>- Edible Leaves Of The Tropics </i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Methods</h2><p><br></p><p>The methods we use to plant, grow, maintain, harvest and propagate crops can make all the difference in both the health of the ecosystem and how much work it requires to maintain.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><b>Give more than you take.</b> Every year that you are gardening the soil should be improving. Even if you aren't getting amazing production right away, adding fertility to the soil is like depositing money in the bank. It's going to make everything so much easier down the line.</li><li><b>Prioritize the population.</b> Some plants die, that is inevitable. Allowing the stronger plants to grow and propagate will lead to a more resilient population better suited to your specific circumstances. It's a better use of time to encourage the plants doing well than it is to try to save the plants doing poorly. Of course, sometimes plants just need a helping hand while they are getting established. </li><li><b>Select by harvesting. </b>If some plants within a population aren't doing well, these are the first ones that should be harvested! They can eaten or put to good use, allowing you to leave the best plants to go to seed. Over the course of many seasons, this will result in a stronger population better suited to your circumstances.</li><li><b>Propagate when harvesting.</b> When harvesting perennial root crops, unless you have more than you need, always propagate at least as much as you are taking. That means when I harvest roots, I can eat some and replant some. Or I can make sure it has produced enough seedlings to keep the population multiplying. It's a small amount of work that goes a long way.</li><li><b>Think 3 years ahead. </b>Many perennials will take 2-3 years to get established, and it can take this long for some annuals or biennials to really become self-sustaining. Most of the time, I'm thinking a few years ahead, and I'm willing to forego any big harvests for the first year or two just so I can learn what the plants need while I establish a strong population. Patience is key.</li><li><b>Plant in different niches. </b>I would much rather have one plant growing really well than than have three of that same plant growing poorly. It's impossible to know exactly what conditions a plant will need without some experimenting. I usually try to plant in a few different areas if I have enough seed/starters - more or less sun, more or less water, different kinds of soil, different microclimates. Even if only one survives but it is clearly in the right spot, I consider that a success because I know it will keep growing without my help. Many seed packets come with hundreds of seeds, so use that to your advantage!</li><li><b>Look at the ground. </b>Wooded areas that receive lots of leaf litter or debris may be better suited for shade-tolerant perennials and plants that spread by rhizomes. A thick layer of mulch means less weeding, but it will make it hard for seeds to reach the soil and germinate. A managed garden bed with a thinner layer of mulch needs more weeding but makes it easier for dispersed seeds to germinate. If you're planting directly into a grass field or lawn, think about plants that thrive in poor soil and can easily compete with grass.</li><li><b>Choose the right mulch.</b> I usually use either fallen leaves or grass clippings as mulch. Leaves are good for building soil, locking in moisture, and preventing weeds from coming up around perennials. But the broad and flat shape of leaves can make it difficult for seedlings to poke through and reach the light. Grass clippings, on the other hand, are great for beds with a lot of germinating seeds because there are usually more openings for light and seedlings to penetrate. But the tradeoff is that this will allow the ground to dry out more. </li><li><b>Messy gardens are healthy gardens. </b>Subdue your desire to make everything look neat and proper. Home gardeners don't need to grow crops in rows with pristine mulch like some farms or nurseries. A diversity of plants living alongside each other makes for more resilient systems and more fun when roaming through the garden. Returning plant material back to the soil is important as well. A layer of sticks, leaves, grass and dead plants on the ground will do wonders.</li><li><b>Curate instead of controlling.</b> Garden beds usually have a host of plants that grow whether you like it or not. Instead of simply ripping them all up, work with them so you can use the beneficial ones to your advantage. Typically this means removing those that spread too aggressively or create too much shade, but letting others cover bare soil, fill in gaps between crops or provide some shelter for germinating seeds. More plants growing means more roots working the soil, more biomass for mulching or composting, and more insects that may not have visited otherwise.</li><li><b>Don't have expectations.</b> You will be much more successful if you are open to growing what your land is well-suited for. Starting with a long list of expected crops and yields will lead to disappointment. Instead, focus on trying to find the right plants that your land can grow abundantly. This may mean you have to rethink what you're eating, but for most of history we have eaten only what the land around us was capable of producing. </li><li><b>Collect local materials. </b>Whenever I'm driving around I always look out for leaves, grass clippings or branches on the curb. These can be used for compost, mulching, or filling in large pots or beds to extend your soil. I have a bunch of old garbage cans in my greenhouse - after drilling holes in the bottom, I fill the bottom half with branches and leaves, then add soil and compost on top. I also collect mushrooms from nearby wooded areas to add to my compost.</li><li><b>Consider how it's harvested.</b> Some root crops like potatoes or sunchoke need to be dug up from the ground, disturbing the surrounding soil. Plant these alongside other root crops or annuals that will be able to reseed themselves. Other roots like radishes, carrots or garlic can be harvested with little disturbance to surrounding plant life, allowing more flexibility for companion plants.</li><li><b>The devil is in the details.</b> In my mind, the best gardens grow so naturally that it appears they haven't been designed at all. But this is because the caretakers have such a nuanced understanding of how plants grow and interact with each other that they are able to work with nature instead of against it. And these gardens often require so little effort that it seems anyone could care for them. But this is the result of mastering an art - an elegance in which no movements are wasted, and every intervention is meaningful. </li><li><b>Bolting can be beneficial.</b> A lot of effort can go into making sure plants don't bolt (go to seed) too early and ruin a good crop. But early bolting can be used to produce more seed and every new generation will be better acclimated to your circumstances. Once you have a large enough population, you can begin selecting for bolt-resistant qualities by cutting down the earliest flowering shoots before they go to seed. Then, only those that bolt later in the season will be able to multiply. </li><li><b>Understand the plants.</b> Incorporating plant species into a larger ecosystem requires an understanding of how each of those plants grow. How cold-tolerant is it? How heat-toleant is it? How much sun does it need? How much water does it need? What kind of soil does it prefer? How long does it live? When does it send up new growth? How big does it get? How aggressively does it spread? How is it harvested? How many seeds does it produce? How are those seeds dispersed? What insects and wildlife interact with it? What kind of management does it require? It's always a good idea to watch the entire lifecycle of a plant over the course of multiple seasons without interfering with it. </li><li><b>Use old shrubs and trees.</b> Vining plants evolved to climb on shrubs and trees, and so there couldn't possibly be a more perfect trellis. Instead of cutting old woody plants down, find a vine that can climb on it. This is especially useful for vines that grow aggressively and smother whatever they are on. This way, it doesn't matter if the tree underneath dies because you were going to cut it down anyway! You may also get the added benefit of the microclimate created by the shrub or tree.</li><li><b>Harvest rain water.</b> If you have a roof and a gutter system then most of the work is already done - congratulations! I have only found one system that is easy, simple, and actually works. All you need to do is a purchase a few parts <a href="https://www.rainbrothers.com/store/DIY-Rain-Barrel-Kit-c73647286" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, and hook them up to a large barrel or trash can (what I use). It is one of the most valuable additions to my garden. Multiple barrels can be hooked together, so expanding the system is easy as well. The only maintenance needed is emptying out the barrels and wiping them down once or twice a year, as well as clearing out the pipes.</li><li><b>Plant trees now.</b> It may be tempting to spend a few years focusing on herbaceous plants before planting any trees, but there is no better advice than to plant trees or other fruit bearing plants as soon as you can. They often require at least a few years of growth before producing any fruit, so there is no sense in waiting! It really is just as simple as digging a hole, sticking the tree in, and watering until it is established. Trees will also create shade, cooler microclimates, and high quality mulch - all of which are important on a planet getting hotter every year. Start small by planting a goumi tree which fixes nitrogen and has edible berries.</li><li><b>Incorporate logs.</b> Large wooden branches or logs provide a lot of benefits that wood chips cannot. Not only do they act as high-quality mulch, they provide shelter to all sorts of insects and wildlife. They also add diversity to the landscape and small niches for plants to take advantage of. You can use them to separate beds or just place them around wherever there is space.</li><li><b>Challenge your plants.</b> Most people are interested in what it will take to keep a plant alive. I want to know what it will take to kill it. Every time I think I understand a plant, it surprises me! They are so much more resilient than I give them credit for. And if I know what conditions they need from firsthand experience, then I don't need to waste my time coddling them. Challenged plants become stronger plants.</li><li><b>Shade is your friend.</b> So many gardeners are worried about having too much shade, convinced they cannot grow food unless they get 12 hours or more of sunlight. If you work on an industrial farm producing cash crops then maybe you are right. But so many excellent vegetables grow in shade - myoga ginger, solomon's seal, daylily, hosta, fuki, udo, miner's lettuce, taro and ostrich fern to name only a few. Shady spots also retain water in the soil much more easily. I am constantly wishing I had more shade!</li><li><b>Spread plants around.</b> Having the same plants in the same spot means they are all subject to the same conditions. I like to have multiple plants of every species spread throughout the garden. This way if insects or wildlife find one, they may not find the other. Or if the weather affects one, it may not affect the other. This is a cornerstone of resiliency. </li><li><b>Start with one plant. </b>Sometimes it can be difficult to get a certain species to grow well in your garden. But if you can make sure just one plant grows to maturity and produces seed, your chances of getting more skyrocket. Fresh seed produced in quantity that has had a generation to acclimate will often grow much better than seed from a packet. In many ways it's also just a numbers game. 100 seeds from a packet may seem like a lot, but consider that a single plant may produce 5-10 times more. Even just letting a few plants go to flower can put thousands of more seeds into your soil.</li><li><b>Judge for yourself. </b>After reading too many references, I have come to only one conclusion - whether a plant is lowly famine food or an elite luxury is entirely made up. The food we eat says more about the whims of culture and the motives of civilization than it does about taste, nutrition or enjoyment. Judge plants for yourself.</li><li><b>Design as you go. </b>So much stress is put on designing the garden to accommodate each species of interest, but how could I possibly design for plants that I've never grown before? I have no idea how they want to live until I've observed them (and maybe killed a few in the process). Plants can always be moved around, nothing is set in stone. Half the time I'm just guessing where they'll grow well. It's not always the best spot, but the more experience I gain with each plant, the more easily I can know where to put them. </li></ul><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Man, do not pride yourself on your superiority to the animals, for they are without sin, while you, with all your greatness, you defile the earth wherever you appear and leave an ignoble trail behind you -- and that is true, alas, for almost every one of us!</i></p><p><i>-Fyodor Dostoyevsky</i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h3>Building Soil &amp; Managing Crops</h3><p>The methods above all fit into a singular holistic approach - working with natural systems to incorporate food crops into the landscape. The plants are our teachers. This mean learning from them without any preconceived notions about how they should grow or what they should be doing. We are watching and listening, not expecting.</p><p>Healthy soil is the backbone of temperate food forests, and plants are natural soil builders: plants build soil using a few primary methods. Sending roots into the soil adds organic matter, aerates the soil and gives it structure. This builds soil from within. After the plants die, their stems and leaves fall over and act as mulch until they fully decompose. Dead plants keep the soil from drying out, return nutrients to the topsoil and offer a sheltered microclimate for everything happening at ground level. This builds soil from above. And the way plants naturally die and return to the ground creates a thick but not overly dense layer of mulch. Most importantly, it has structure. It allows space for other seeds to germinate and grow while still offering shelter from the elements. When one plant dies it creates the right environment for the next plant to take its spot, to work the soil with its roots, and then to become mulch for the next plant. This is the genius of nature.</p><p>So our two most important methods of building soil are using the power of roots to work the soil, and returning organic matter back to the topsoil as mulch. In the garden we can imitate these patterns by letting plants cover as much ground as possible. The more roots we have working the soil for us, the better. Of course, we can't let every single plant grow to maturity or else there would be no room for our food crops. This is where we come in. We can curate which plants to let grow and which to cut down. By cutting down plants in the garden and letting them fall over as mulch, we are imitating a natural soil-building pattern. So instead of ripping everything up and dumping an even mat of mulch on our beds, we can build the soil more naturally. </p><p>Practically, implementing this system is fairly straightforward because we are letting nature do most of the work for us. There will be a host of plants growing in our garden beds whether we like or not - these are working the soil for us, attracting insects and sheltering the soil. If any plants are competing too much with our food crops, we just cut them down and let them fall where they are. The more aggressive the species is the more often those plants will need to be cut down. If we let them grow they may get too big and shade out our food crops, or they may spread too aggressively and out compete our food crops. But the species that present little competition to our food crops need less management. Some of them may be edible themselves, some may attract beneficial insects, some may provide shelter. We are looking at the ground and seeing which plants are working for us and which ones aren't. Those that aren't get cut down and now they are working for us as mulch! If these species are continually cut down without being allowed to produce seed, then over time our jobs will become easier as fewer and fewer of their seeds remain in the topsoil. Essentially we are speeding up and intervening with a natural process in order build soil and integrate our food crops. Then the food we grow can become a functioning part of the local ecosystem. </p><p>This system works particularly well for beds with annuals and biennials that rely on seed dispersal for their continued survival. A thick layer of mulch would lock in moisture but prevent the dispersed seeds from germinating. A thin layer of mulch would allow the seeds to germinate but dry the soil out. And any native plants that get through end up in the compost, removing nutrients from that patch of soil. Even if you were to add the compost back, there is no easy way to do this without either disturbing the soil or covering it with enough mulch so it doesn't immediately dry out. Now we are back to our original problem. But mulching in place with native plants creates a structured mulch that is thick enough to lock in moisture but fluffy enough to allow seeds to germinate. It also allows us to work within a sustainable, closed loop. We are not depending on mulch or soil delivered from somewhere else - everything we need is being grown right on our own land. And by letting plants cover the soil, we are creating the right environment for insects. Bugs need a diverse landscape with a variety of physical niches to take advantage of. They don't like flat sheets of mulch. If we didn't have the right balance of insects, we would constantly be fighting against them. This method of management invites them all in to sort it out amongst themselves.</p><p>Moving beyond building soil, we can also imitate how plants naturally disperse seed. Direct seeding right into the ground is effective and produces high germination rates, but there are drawbacks. If all the seedlings germinate at roughly the same time, they are all subject to identical conditions during identical phases of growth. If a dry spell occurs right after germination and the seedlings are not drought tolerant enough, they will all die unless they are watered. Or a slug may come through and eat them all. Or a bunny may walk on them. Or a heavy downpour may damage them. Or it may be too sunny and they'll get scorched. Any number of things could happen to affect them. But when seeds are naturally dispersed through whatever mechanism the plant uses, they tend to fall in different places, perhaps they are in pods that break open at different times, they may land in slightly different niches. Many will not germinate at all, some will fall into soil and germinate right away, some will sit on a leaf until being knocked over a few months later, some will get moved around by the birds. Some will germinate and die because of the weather or because they landed in the wrong niche. Only a small percentage of them will grow to maturity - this is natural, and this is why plants produce so many seeds (hundreds or thousands). But even though the rate of germination is much lower, the resiliency of that population is so much higher. So whenever possible we are imitating the natural dispersal of seeds. </p><p>For annuals or biennials this method requires a lot of seed. A single plant can produce thousands of seeds and only a small portion of those may grow to maturity. If we buy a seed packet with only 50 seeds, it may be necessary to carefully grow a few out in managed conditions to drastically increase the seed count before dispersing them on our beds. If we only dispersed 50, it's possible none would grow to maturity. Dispersing 5,000 significantly improves our chances. This is the power a single generation can have on the population of a species. But even with the help we provide - weeding, mulching, managing beds, seed dispersal - some plants will simply not be suited for our soil or climate without a lot of management. So it's just as important to find the right species for our specific conditions. We can't expect to drop any old plant in and have it grow! This is why our plant selection prioritizes resiliency. </p><p>The amazing result of this method is that the plants that do succeed become stronger with every generation. And before long we will have a garden full of food that grows and propagates itself with very little effort. Of course, there will be regular maintenance like weeding and dispersing seed. Every garden requires maintenance (even mature food forests), but this method allows us to use natural processes to our advantage and intervene only when it is meaningful. This is not a step by step plan with a full proof outcome. This is a dance.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>What would it mean for us to come to terms with the knowledge that civilization, our whole mode of development and culture, has been premised and built upon extermination—on a history experienced as "terror without end" (to borrow a phrase from Adorno)? To dwell on such a thought would be to throw into almost unbearable relief the distance between our narratives of inherent human dignity and grace and moral superiority, on the one hand, and the most elemental facts of our actual social existence, on the other. </i></p><p><i>We congratulate ourselves for our social progress—for democratic governance and state-protected civil and human rights (however notional or incompletely defended)—yet continue to enslave and kill millions of sensitive creatures who in many biological, hence emotional and cognitive particulars resemble us.

form the foundation of a resilient and productive garden. This is based on a few different criteria: how easy they are to grow and use, how drought tolerant they are, their culinary and medicinal qualities, and whether they can function as a staple crop. </p><p><br></p><h3>Herbs</h3><ul><li><b>Mentha Spp. (Mint): </b>One of the easiest herbs to grow, even in very poor soil. Can be planted directly into a lawn and do just fine. </li><li><b>Origanum Spp. (Oregano):</b> Excellent in the kitchen, especially the Greek variety. Tolerant of most soil conditions and more well behaved than mint, too.</li><li><b>Thymus Spp. (Thyme): </b>Many varieties create a thick, low growing carpet when fully established. Makes a wonderful groundcover with many culinary uses.</li></ul><h3>Roots</h3><ul><li><b>Apios Americana (Groundnut):</b> A woodland vining plant, so it needs relatively rich and moist soil. But it fills a useful niche in that the tubers can be grown in the understory. They are easy to harvest, full of protein, and simple to cook. Also a nitrogen fixer.</li><li><b>Canna Edulis (Achira): </b>Gorgeous Peruvian root crop with large, showy tropical leaves and flowers. Needs sun and moist soil. Large, sweet rhizome clusters are easy to harvest and cook with.</li><li><b>Colocasia Esculenta (Taro)</b>: If you have moist soil and shade this is one of the best vegetables to plant. Delicious corms, stems and leaves are produced in quantity. Some varieties mature in under 6 months.</li><li><b>Helianthus Tuberosus (Sunchoke):</b> Probably the best plant for anyone to grow. It grows in poor soil, has very moderate water needs, and forms an abundance of tubers. Lots of food without a lot of work, an excellent staple crop.</li><li><b>Lycopus Lucidus (Chinese Bugleweed):</b> A resilient and medicinal plant with small juicy tubers. A great way to add diversity to your root crops. </li><li><b>Solanum Ajanhuiri (Potato): </b>This species is not the common potato, but a variety from Peru known for its frost resistance. It's also more resistant to pests, so it makes for a great alternative. An essential staple root crop.</li><li><b>Tropaeolum Tuberosum (Mashua): </b>Another root crop from the Andes, this species has excellent production of tubers that form in the shorter days of fall. A staple for the garden that also produces edible leaves and flowers.</li><li><b>Allium Cepa Proliferum (Walking Onion):</b> One of the most resilient onions, more tolerant of poor soil and dry conditions than most others. Multiplies every year and can be used for its bulb or greens. Grow hundreds of these and use them as your onion staple.</li></ul><h3>Vegetables</h3><ul><li><b>Angelica Sylvestris (Angelica):</b> A gorgeous short lived perennial that has just as much a place in the flower garden as it does the kitchen! Edible stems and leaves have many uses.</li><li><b>Bunias Orientalis (Turkish Rocket):</b> One of the easiest and most straightforward perennial vegetables. Use like rapini or miniature broccoli when it sends up flowering shoots. A resilient staple vegetable for poor soil.</li><li><b>Chenopodium Bonus-Henricus (Good King Henry):</b> A classic perennial vegetable that grows quickly and easily. High quality spinach-like leaves and a tasty inflorescence.</li><li><b>Opuntia Humifosa (Prickly Pear):</b> This cold hardy, edible cactus is great for poor soil. Preparation requires removing the thorns and invisible glochids, but I see it as an essential edition to the resilient garden. Both pads and fruit can be eaten.</li><li><b>Perilla Frutescens (Shiso): </b>An annual in the mint family with fragrant leaves that reseeds itself generously. The green varieties are used as a vegetable and can be grown in quantity, multiplying every year.</li><li><b>Sedum Sarmentosum (Dolnamul): </b>A hardy perennial succulent that is often eaten raw in salads. Tolerant of rough conditions like other succulents and quickly forms large mats.</li><li><b>Smyrnium Olusatrum (Alexanders):</b> A resilient alternative to celery from ancient Rome, all parts of this plant are edible. A short lived perennial that will multiply around the garden after going to seed.</li></ul><h3>Fruit</h3><ul><li><b>Actinidia Arguta (Hardy Kiwi): </b>The vigorous and hardy cousin to the kiwi we are all so familiar with. This vining species produces small, hairless kiwis that are even tastier.</li><li><b>Elaeagnus Multiflora (Goumi):</b> A small tree with edible berries that fixes nitrogen and grows well even in shade. An excellent choice to support other crops while producing tasty berries of its own. </li><li><b>Prunus Americana (Plum):</b> A north American native, this small tree grows into thickets and produces small plums that range from tart to sweet. </li><li><b>Rubus Idaeus (Raspberry):</b> Another native that is easy to grow and produces delicious berries. Spreads quickly by rhizome once established and sends up new canes every year.</li></ul><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Guide</h2><p><br></p><p><b>Annual/Perennial: </b>Designations for Zone 7, may differ in other climates. I typically try to use the most common English name for the plant, although it can be confusing for some species that have no good names or that share names with other species. The Latin name is always the most accurate.</p><p><b>Edible:</b> Useful edible parts. Not comprehensive, not a reference, only a starting point. Do not eat anything you are not 100% familiar with. Always consult multiple sources, see resources above. Frequently if the leaf is edible then so is the tender new growth, harvested with some of the new stem. In fact, when the leaves are small or tightly bunched, this can often be the best time to harvest. I only indicate the stem is edible when it constitutes a meaningful portion of the edible harvest or when it can be eaten even when relatively mature. For example, mint leaves or amaranth can be eaten with some of the tender stem, but I only write the leaf is edible because the stem is insignificant to the harvest. However, when water spinach or shungiku is harvested, the stem constitutes a meaningful part of the vegetable and is therefore included in the edible portions. Shoot refers only to the young growth of the plant when it first emerges from the ground (i.e., the entire young plant, often in spring). How large of a shoot is harvested depends on the specific plant. Just because a shoot is edible<i> </i>does <i>not</i> indicate that the leaf, stem or any part of the mature plants is edible. Often if the mature leaves of a plant are edible then so is the shoot, but if the mature harvests are just as good then there is no reason to stunt the growth of a plant by harvesting the shoot. Therefore, the shoot is only indicated as edible when it constitutes a meaningfully different harvest than at a different point in the plant's life cycle. Flowering shoots are a separate identification and these are indicated as inflorescence to avoid confusion. These are usually eaten when still young, clustered and tender. The best way to know how to eat a plant is to do research, grow it and become familiar with it. Even with references, the actual details of how it's harvested and eaten can vary significantly between plants.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Useful methods of propagation. Usually seed, stem cutting, or rhizome/tuber. Seeds that prefer cold stratification or sunlight to germinate are often noted as such. Often I try to get bare roots or potted plants if a seed is difficult to germinate.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Rough guidelines for minimum sun requirements. Deep shade (≈70%) → Shade (≈50%) → Part Shade (≈30%) → Sun (≈10%). I usually find that plants do alright with less sun than what is typically suggested. Most of the time, if a plant prefers shade, it will also prefer rich and moist soil. And keep in mind that just because a plants prefers sun doesn't mean it can handle the scorching heat summer often brings. This is often true for plants that grow at high altitudes or in coastal climates.</p><p><b>Wildlife:</b> Impact of wildlife and insects on plant. We have lots of deer as well as chipmunks, rabbits and birds that live nearby. I try to grow enough food for everyone, but I can't let them eat everything! I have some fenced areas for sensitive plants I don't want being bothered. I try to be as hands-off as possible and rarely remove insects from plants or interfere with their growth. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Everything else. Observations about growth habits, useful varieties, hardiness, harvesting, interactions with other plants and more. Plants with photos were grown in Maryland, roughly Z7. You may notice some of the plants in my photos don't look perfectly healthy - this is okay. If it is a perennial, as long as it has a healthy root system it will grow just fine after being planted and given a few seasons to adjust. Winters have been mild lately, only a few inches of snow and some ice. Summer alternates between very hot and heavy rain. Soil has poor-drainage and some clay, but is mostly good. Normally the only time I water plants is while they are getting established. Most non-perennial plants survive (or die) exclusively on rain water.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Herbs</h2><p><br></p><h3>Agastache Rugosa 'Korean Mint' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. May grow well in meadows. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">EASY &amp; VIGOROUS</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Members of this genus are known as hyssops. I love the aroma of this species, makes a great tea. <b>A. foeniculum</b> is common as well. Some others. </p><p><br></p><h3>Anethum Graveolens 'Dill' | Annual </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">SELF SOWS</b></p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant. Attracts beneficial insects. </p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Good pollinator that can grow in between plants without competing. It takes up practically no space so I spread it all around the garden. Great seed production, should reseed itself easily. Useful herb for pickling. </p><p><br></p><h3>Asarum C<b>anadense</b> 'Wild Ginger' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Rhizome.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed. Cold stratify. May be difficult from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to shade. Woodland. Shelter from heat.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Rhizomes can be used as a garnish. Always eat in moderation as there are reports of toxicity for parts of the plant. Don't eat leaves. This species is most commonly sold here, but <b>A. europaeum</b> is also used the same way. Despite its limited use it makes a beautiful groundcover for shady spots. Grows alongside ramps in the wild, may be useful to imitate this in the garden. Rhizomes will give you a quicker start.</p><p><br></p><h3>Chenopodium Ambrosioides 'Epazote' | Annual </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Mexican herb, not the most versatile given its aroma. May be useful as deer deterrent. </p><p><br></p><h3>Diplotaxis Tenuifolia 'Wild Rocket' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>There are a few genera with species that get referred to as cress or rocket, so it's easy to get confused. This is a standard perennial species that's easy to find, a useful alternative to arugula. Used in moderation as the taste can be sharp. Should do well in shade.</p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/io3v0693qehu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A young plant in a pot.</a></p><h3><br></h3><h3>Eruca Vesicaria Sativa 'Arugula' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Useful garnish that reseeds itself. Prefers some shade so it won't bolt as quickly. Many different varieties to experiment with, some have much larger leaves than others.</p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/20g55ldsejho" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">These plants bolted almost immediately due to the hot weather</a>. <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/po49td6eeiis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Close up of flowers.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Foeniculum Vulgare 'Fennel' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">DROUGHT TOLERANT</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Hardy perennial herb, can spread rapidly in dry climates. There are basically two different kinds - those with a fat bulb that are cooked like a vegetable and those without that are used more as an herb. I believe the bulbing varieties would need more water to properly develop. </p><p><br></p><h3>Inula Helenium 'Elecampane' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>The real potential of this beautiful plant lies in the root - it can be grated and used as a garnish. It swells up fairly quickly. Young leaves are edible although they smell skunky, may be useful as deer deterrent. Mature leaves are very lage, a real statement piece. Both this species and <b>I. racemosa</b> are used medicinally. </p><p><br></p><h3>Lavandula Angustifolia 'Lavender' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes:</b> Compact herb that grows similar to rosemary but more tolerant of soil and cold. Limited culinary use but may be useful for its wonderful aroma when making things like soap. Many varieties within this species. <b>L. latifolia</b> is used in the same way.</p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/cfa1rl77b4ge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A cutting that's been growing for a year in a sunny spot.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/2c9uoikltot8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Close up of leaves.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Melissa Officinalis 'Lemon Balm' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">EASY &amp; VIGOROUS</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes:</b> Another simple plant from the mint family and an easy way to add some diversity to the herb garden.

Not preferable for garden beds, may be better suited where it can be given space and managed easily. I like planting mints in shady spots or poor soil as it slows down the growth and doesn't take space away from other plants that need better conditions. <b>M. requienii</b>, corsican mint, is the only species in this genus that forms a good groundcover. It grows slowly at first and is very small so it needs to be managed while getting established. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>Monarda Fisulosa 'Bee Balm' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.

Some varieties are bushier while some prefer to climb. There can be big differences in root size between varieties, make sure to get an improved variety. Small harvest after one season or leave in ground for as long as you want so tubers can grow larger. Probably best on a 2-3 year rotation, similar to some other perennial root crops. Nitrogen fixer, but since the root is harvested it's unlikely to benefit the soil as much as other fixers. As far as food forests go, I am interested in this species as being able to grow around other plants in partial shade. So instead of dedicating space, it can grow between and climb on other crops. Production will be lower this way but it serves a niche that few other root crops are able to (codonopsis comes to mind). Other species within this genus may also be useful but there is very little information available.</p><p><br></p><h3>Arctium Lappa 'Burdock' | Biennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, root.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.

If growing as a perennial, to harvest just slice off the newer rhizome with a shovel and pull them up, leaving the older ones in the ground. Shoots are a vegetable as well but less practical if growing as an annual. Produces a lot of top growth with beautiful, thick leaves that become excellent mulch after harvest. This is probably one of the best mulch plants in my garden. <b>C. indica</b> can be grown and used the same way but there is no reason to do this because the yields are much lower. </p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/9dko6slopboe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Leaves coming up in spring.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Chaerophyllum Bulbosum 'Root Chervil' | Biennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.

Hardy to about Z6 or Z7, but there are more cold hardy species as well. May prefer dry soil to overwinter. Most species in this genus seem to produce edible roots. Likes some shade as the young growth can be sensitive to heat and frost. Tubers grow larger every year, often harvested at 2-3 years old. </p><p>Amazing potential as a root crop for the forest garden, especially the vining varieties.

The young plants are able to grow right through groundcovers because the leaves shoot upwards as soon as they start growing. This allows them to handle competition well and poke through to the sun fairly quickly. In just one generation there is enough of them in the ground to start selecting for vigor and late bolting. In my conditions and climate these seem to grow more easily than radish - they can be used to improve soil in the same way, although the roots tend to be smaller. Some varieties will be more cold-hardy and have the potential to be overwintered in ground.

The old name is<b> D. opposita</b>. Most yams are only grown in the tropics (or grown as annuals), but this species is particularly cold hardy. Aerial tubers can spread and propagate themselves, best planted in a spot where it cannot escape and where management is easy. Roots are fragile, should be grown in bag/tube/barrel that can be easily dug up without disturbing root. Plastic drainage pipes are used as well. Root takes about 2-3 years to harvest, aerial tubers are good crop until then. If growing for aerial tuber crop, best to set aside some roots to leave in ground indefinitely, as older roots will produce more and larger aerial tubers. Needs a large trellis to climb on. When planting aerial tubers, be aware they may take weeks or months to send up leaves. It's a great plant but given that it's difficult to harvest straight out of the ground and that it can spread rapidly by bulbils makes it more annoying to grow than other perennials. Once you have a good setup in a good spot it's no problem though.</p><p>The book <i>Ethnobotany and Useful Resource Plants of Dokdo and Ulleung Island in Korea</i> indicates that the tender new growth of this particular species can be eaten after being cooked. <b>D. japonica</b>, the Japanese species, is also cold hardy and can be eaten the same way. <i>Cornucopia</i> indicates the tender new growth of this Japanese species is edible as well.

Many pests, affecting some varieties more than others.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established + S. curtilobum and S. tuberosum.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Because of deer pressure I grow potatoes in a fenced area. The goal is to harvest them in the fall once their foliage dies back, and then immediately replant them to stay in the ground over winter. This should reduce the amount of work as well as soil disturbance. Harvesting them all at once means I don't have to worry about which ones are short-day and which ones are day-neutral.</p><p>Keeping potatoes in the ground this way is not usually done because of disease/insect pressure and frost sensitivity. Wild potatoes are more resistant to disease/insects and frost but they are usually much smaller and not safe to eat. They are also difficult to harvest because of how far their stolons spread underground. Domestication has made potatoes larger, more stationary, and more edible but has also weakened their resistances. </p><p>Potato species that retain some of these resistances should be able to be grown in a more perennial way. I think this species, sometimes called ajawiri, should be an excellent choice. <b>S. curtilobum</b> may also be a good option, a beautiful purple potato although it only forms tubers during short days in fall. <b>S. tuberosum </b>is the standard domesticated species, and often suffers from pests and disease. </p><p><br></p><h3>Stachys Affinis 'Crosne' | Perennial ⚫</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.

Tolerates dry soil, multiplies quickly, and can be used for bulbs or scallions. Easy to propagate, simply bury bulbets around garden or divide the bulbs at the base of the plant. Some varieties have larger bulbets than others, and some have sharper tasting leaves than others. After dividing a clump, planting the divisions deep into the soil will result in a larger, blanched bulb good for cooking.</p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Fistulosum 'Bunching Onion' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Potted.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Useful as another form of scallion, will multiply and patches can be divided for propagation.

Some pests.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established - multiple varieties.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to propagate via bulbs. You can plant the aerial bulbets, although they will take longer to produce a good crop. Varieties originally collected in the wild may have interesting qualities. Scapes and leaves make for good vegetables as well. The cloves can be planted any time of year but you will only get a good bulb for storage if planted in fall and harvested next summer (after flowering but before the bulb starts to divide). I am primarily interested in a more patient approach to garlic, and I don't give them any special treatment. Those that are in the right conditions, get enough rainwater, and are growing well can be harvested in the summer as storage bulbs.</p><p>For the plants that aren't growing as well or whose leaves have prematurely died back for whatever reason, there are two options. They can still be harvested as wet garlic - the bulbs are usually still in perfect shape even if the leaves have all died. This is an excellent crop with its own special culinary uses. Or they can be left in the ground to come back up when the tempertures have cooled down. Letting the garlic sit in the ground longer and divide won't give you a good storage bulb, instead you'll get a clump of smaller bulbs. This is fine. The clump can remain as is, you can continue to harvest the small wet bulbs, leaves and scapes that will now be produced in quantity. Or you can divide the clump and plant out all the individual bulbs. These can be grown back into storage bulbs if they are separated and re-planted in the fall (whenever you plant the cloves from the storage bulbs).</p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/olmgskqdikv8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A young garlic plant.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Tricoccum 'Ramp' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, seed. Cold stratify.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Grows in forest understory, getting all its light in early spring before the trees leaf out.

They can be blanched but they don't need to be. Young stems and leaves are also edible while the plant is still in its early phase of growth. Once it gets bigger they become too tough. Can grow very large before dying back in winter. <b>A. racemosa</b> has different edible properties and is less commonly cultivated for this purpose.</p><p><br></p><h3>Artemisia P<b>rinceps</b> 'Japanese Mugwort' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">EASY &amp; VIGOROUS</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>This is used in some traditional Asian cuisine. Seems to grow quite easily, forming strong clumps at least 4 feet high. Shoots are the best vegetable. Tender new growth can be used as a flavoring or vegetable as well. There is a variety that only grows about a foot tall and forms a groundcover. I don't know if it is within this species or not, but it is useful as it doesn't get tall and can grow more easily under other plants. <b>A. vulgaris,</b> common mugwort, is edible in the same way along with many others. Said to be a lucid dreaming aid, can be infused as tea or smoked. </p><p><br></p><h3>Asparagus Officinalis 'Asparagus' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Probably the most common perennial vegetable.

Bunnies nibble on leaves, but typically don't damage more than a few. Susceptible to cabbage worm and aphids, are a serious nuisance. Birds sit on flowering stalks and eat the bugs off.</p><p><b>Notes: B. oleracea</b> has many varieties including broccoli, cabbage, kale and cauliflower. This particular species of kale has some perennial forms, which is why it is one of my favorites. To propagate by stem simply place it in some soil and keep it moist until roots form. Seed purchased <a href="https://store.experimentalfarmnetwork.org/products/kaleidescope-perennial-kale-grex?variant=33357265141813" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>, highly recommended. Some forms are tender and well-suited for eating raw but these are often the first ones attacked by insects. The thick-leaved, tougher forms have a noticeably higher resistance to insects.</p><p>This species will flower in the spring and can continue flowering through summer. Flower spikes can get huge and a single plant may produce thousands of seeds. </p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/lanm40a1q5qj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One of the nicer specimens of perpetual kale going to bloom in April after a year of growth.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/c96f7a1pujbk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Close up of leaves.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/4rogdjaquoea" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flowering shoot of different plant in same species.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/6jmj23rkrta6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flowers opening up.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Brassica Rapa Purpurea 'Hon Tsai Tai' | Annual </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf, inflorescence.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Notes: B. rapa</b> has many varieties including turnips, rapini and bok choy.

The best plant for salads I have come across, very tasty and succulent. The special quality of these plants is that they taste great even after flowering, whereas most plants are harvested before this stage to reduce bitterness. This makes it a feast for the eyes as well when served with the flower. This species is most commonly available, <b>C. sibirica</b> is also great. Cold-tolerant to about Z7, so hopefully it will overwinter in my climate. Does not handle heat well. Even within species there seems to be a great deal of variation. Some other species in the genus are edible as well. The plants are very small and fragile while getting established. Direct seeding has not worked too well for me given how messy my beds are. Transplanting seems to work well, although they start off slow. Beautiful plants. Would be worth more research.</p><p><br></p><h3>Colocasia Esculenta 'Taro' | Annual 🖤</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Corm, petiole, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Corm.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. Wet soil. Shelter from heat.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant. Virtually no problems.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>This species has over 80 edible varieties. Some varieties are ornamental but even those that are edible often have different edible uses depending on the variety. Some are grown for corms while others are grown for leaf stems or young leaves. All parts of plant contain calcium oxalate, so must be cooked thoroughly to be safe to eat. Corms need especially thorough preparation. I have a few different varieties that I am currently trialing. Named varieties are difficult to find outside of Hawaii so these are anything I can get my hands on.</p><ol><li>Miyako: Japanese variety cultivated for the cormels, leaf stalks and leaves. Matures in less than 10 months, producing over 20 cormels.</li><li>Tsurunoko : Japanese variety cultivated for cormels. Matures within 6 months, producing up to 40 cormels. Excellent potential for temperate cultivation due to quick maturity and good keeping qualities of corm.</li><li>Bun Long: Chinese variety cultivated for the corm and young leaves. Matures in 9-12 months, producing up to 20 cormels.</li><li>Maui Lehua: Hawaiian hybrid variety cultivated for the corm, usually as poi. Matures in 8-12 months, producing up to 5 cormels.</li><li>Korean: Korean variety cultivated for the corm and leaf stalk. Name was uknown by seller.</li></ol><p>For an index of some varieties, see the classic source <a href="https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/B-084.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Taro Varieties Of Hawaii</a>, or <a href="https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/Site/Taro.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University Of Hawaii</a> and <a href="https://www.kupunakalo.com/kalo-varieties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kupuna Kalo</a>. Most do not reliably overwinter below Z8. Good drainage will help your chances, as will planting it near the house or in a sheltered microclimate with a thick layer of mulch. They are still worth growing as annuals, bringing the corms indoors over winter and storing them in a cool, dry medium (same as you would a canna rhizome). They are better producers when annualy harvested and seperated. Just like the potato - it can be grown as a perennial and there are uses for that, but with limited space it makes sense to grow it as an annual for best production. The difference being that taro corms must be put somewhere warm in colder climates, which is more effort than simply putting it right back in the ground after harvest to overwinter. I believe filtered sunlight in a location sheltered from the hottest parts of the day with rich and wet soil are the ideal conditions for this plant. </p><p>Taro is a plant that you need to be familiar with how each specific variety is eaten. With varieties like Tsurunoko or Miyako, the main corm is too acrid but the dorment cormels are the main crop. Others are used for the main corm, and some others may be used only for the leaves.</p><p><b>C. gigantea</b> is used only for its leaf stems, the corm is not eaten. The leaf stems are an excellent vegetable, great for soup and produced in quantity, known as Bac Ha. Many references indicate they need to be peeled, although I believe this may only apply to the older and tougher stems. I have eaten tender stems without peeling and they have been very pleasant. Perhaps in countries where it is evergreen, the stems have more time to get tough. This species overwinters in my climate with no protection, even with relatively wet soil, sprouting in late June. I imagine it could overwinter even in colder areas (I have seen reports of it overwintering in Z6). Some clones such as 'Thailand Giant' or similar ones sold in nurseries are not used for food and are less hardy. However the common variety used for food can be found on ebay or etsy. This species is also more resilient than taro and can easily withstand periods of dry soil and heat. Unlike most taro varieties this species seems to spread by stolon, so after a season of growth it will start to form patches. Given the large leaves and how vigorously this plant grows, it is also a good mulch plant. </p><p>Plants in this genus are very closely related to those in the Alocasia genus, some of which are used as food as well. Bac Ha is often incorrectly identified as coming from this genus (even in a reference book I have). I don't think any Alocaisa species are cultivated for food in temperate climates.</p><p><br></p><h3>Cryptotaenia Japonica 'Mitsuba' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Potted.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Also called Japanese honewort. <b>C. canadensis</b> is American variety.

This plant is tolerant of dry soil and heat. It goes to flower almost as soon as it starts growing, and these flowers mature into seeds quickly. So even a very young plant has the ability to reseed itself - this is why it's so hard to get rid of. Flowers are edible but not palatable. Entire plant eaten when still young. Used in at least a few countries.

If you are concerned, my recommendation is to stick to the varieties with a history of being eaten. Along with this yellow flowering species eaten in Japan, this includes <b>H. fulva </b>(common orange ditch lily)<b> </b>and <b>H. lilioasphodelus/H. flava </b>(shorter plant with sweet-scented, yellow flowers). I don't think any species are toxic and even though most should be fine, try new varieties with care and in small amounts. </p><p>Flowers are eaten as buds or fully opened. They are cooked, dried, pickled, or sometimes eaten raw. The flowers are sweet, tasty and produced in quantity. Shoots are occasionally cooked as vegetables as well, mature leaves are never eaten. I would recommend avoiding the roots even though some references indicate they are edible. Historically, the flowers and shoots are the main crops, not the roots. <i>Edible Wild Plants Of Vietnam </i>also indicates the roots of at least one species used for edible flowers has mildly poisonous roots.</p><p>Daylilies will grow in most soils and do fine in fairly deep shade. They make an easy understory for fruit trees. They can be aggressive spreaders so put in a spot that's easy to manage. Overall, they are an excellent perennial vegetable very well suited for food forest projects.</p><p><br></p><h3>Heracleum Sphondylium 'Cow Parsnip' | Biennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> None.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Wild vegetable.

Young shoots and very young leaves. Tolerant of most conditions, but not too dry. Useful for deep shade where edible options are limited. Although the deer love it, there shouldn't be a problem harvesting the shoots as they typically only eat it later on in the growth cycle. Bigger species will give you bigger shoots. Flowers are mild and pleasant. I would say the same for hostas as I would for daylilies - most species should be fine but try new varieties with care and in small amounts at first. An excellent perennial vegetable for food forests.</p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/thst5kujutco" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A patch of hosta shoots (not sure what species) ready to be harvested.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Ipomoea Aquatica 'Water Spinach' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Wet soil. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>In the same genus as sweet potato and morning glory (with similarly beautiful flowers). Common vegetable in southeast Asia, normally grown in more tropical climates but seems to have potential for growing and reseeding itself in temperate climates. Tender new growth is edible. Needs wet soil, may succeed in understory. Good potential because it is a leafy vegetable that spreads quickly by rhizome. Wait until the nights start to warm up to plant. The difficulty with this plant on a no-irrigation pattern is that it needs a very wet and very sunny spot - not an easy combination in many climates. My strategy is adding as much mulch as possible and putting it in a spot with rich soil at the bottom of a small hill. Interesting companion planting possibilites - achira may be a good choice.</p><p><br></p><h3>Ligularia Fischeri 'Gomchwi' | Perennial ⚫</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.

The food of ancient Roman gladiators! There are many hulless varieties that are easy to process at home. <a href="https://greatlakesstapleseeds.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Great Lake Staple Seeds</a> has a good selection. The best barley harvests will come from cool weather, and this has the added benefit of more moisture in the soil. In my climate I don't need to water barley beyond what the rain provides. Spring barley can be dispersed at the end of winter when the ground starts to thaw. Winter barley can be dispersed in the late fall when the weather cools down.</p><p>Barley will mature in about 2-3 months and the seed heads should be allowed to dry out on the stalk. Once they are brown and brittle, collect them. For small amounts, hulless varieties can be rolled through your hands to loosen the seed. For larger amounts, they can be placed in a bowl or bucket and mashed with a stick, mortar and pestle style. Once the hulls are removed they can then be winnowed by pouring from bucket to bucket next to a fan or on a windy day.</p><p>It can be planted alongside clover or other nitrogen-fixing crops to keep the soil healthy. I grow mine in small patch of grass. Mow the area as close to the ground as you can, disperse the barley along with any companion crops, and then cover with the mowed grass. This pattern works well for barley because it does fine in poor soil with a lot of competition. In fact, one of the reasons I love barley so much is that compared to other grains it does very well with competition from other grasses and plants. Most other grains don't do as well in this kind of environment.</p><p><br></p><h3>Sorghum Bicolor 'Sorghum' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.

All need rich, acidic soil like the blueberry. The genus Pernettya is used by nurseries for designating plants but has been merged with this one. </p><p><br></p><h3>Lycium Barbarum 'Goji' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Fruit, leaves.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, cutting.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Potted.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow from seed, doesn't need to be stratified and germination is good. Leaves can be eaten as well, although some forms will be better for this than others. There are some improved forms but few nurseries offer anything beside the common one. Taste and size of berries can differ between forms as well. A similar situation to the goumi tree since all the clones come out of China. </p><p><br></p><h3>Maclura Tricuspidata 'Che' | Perennial ⚫</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Fruit.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, cutting.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>An uncommon fruit tree related to <b>M. pomifera</b>, the inedible osange orange. Small red fruit that supposedly taste like mulberries and figs. Most varieties need a male and a female but there are self-fertile varieties (so get one of those!). Often grafted onto osange orange rootstock to prevent it from suckering and becoming too bushy. When mature they should grow to 20 feet tall. This will be one of the largest trees in my backyard when fully grown. </p><p><br></p><h3>Morus Nigra 'Black Mulberry' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Fruit.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, cutting. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">EASY &amp; VIGOROUS</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Large trees, can grow up to 50 feet tall with incredible production of mild and sweet berries.

There is a common black-fruiting variety called 'Dwarf Everbearing' that is not actually a dwarf variety, do not believe what you read online. The amount of websites and nurseries that claim this variety is a dwarf tree is just astounding. I believe what you are actually buying is a repackaged 'Illinois Everbearing' hybrid variety that grows to 30+ feet. It can be kept short and still produce fruit but that means you will have to heavily prune it every year. <a href="https://ediblelandscaping.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edible Landscaping</a> has far superior options available for actual dwarf trees.</p><p><br></p><h3>Passiflora Incarnata 'Maypop' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, fruit.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, cutting. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">EASY &amp; VIGOROUS</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>A vining plant that produces small fruits filled with sweet jelly.

Tons of options within this genus. This species is the classic red raspberry bush. It has a perennial root system that send up new canes every year, but each cane only fruits the second year before dying. The thimbleberry, <b>R. parviflorus</b>, fruits less than raspberries but doesn't have any thorns, grows taller and the canes live longer and continue producing. The Japanese wineberry, <b>R. phoenicolasius</b>, is an extremely thorny scrambling bush although it can be trellised. <b>R. fruticosus</b> is the blackberry. There are also groundcovers with modest fruiting like <b>R. calycinoides</b>, the Taiwanese creeping raspberry. It is small and not the most productive crop but covers ground well. <b>R. nepalensis</b>, the Nepalese raspberry,<b> </b>is also a ground cover but with larger fruits. This one is less common but worth more testing. Most are fairly aggressive growers in this climate. Many others.</p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/pm8nh159ipf3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A thimbleberry cane in early spring.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/rco8bmf6uvu7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A raspberry cane flowering.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Ribes Nigrum 'Currant' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Fruit.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, cutting.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Shade tolerant bush.

Also used medicinally. Needs male and female to fruit, so grow out multiple seedlings. Seeds should be scarified and soaked as they are tough to germinate otherwise. Grows as a vine, tips can root when they touch soil. Tender new growth can be eaten as a vegetable as well. It is interesting that this species of gourd is the only one that is so cold hardy, likely to at least Z6.</p><p><br></p><h3>Vaccinium C<b>orymbosum</b> 'Blueberry' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Fruit.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, cutting.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. Rich soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>This species is the popular blueberry with two main forms - lowbush and highbush. Lowbush is the cold hardy wild form that is a smaller plant with smaller berries. Highbush is the cultivated form, a bigger plant with bigger berries and better heat tolerance. There are hybrids as well. This species is the most common but there are many other worthwhile species in this genus. All need acidic soil, growing naturally in acidic forest soil, so may not be the easiest plant for the backyard garden without some preparation. However, I think that making sure there is a lot of organic matter in/on the soil is often good enough. Place it in a spot with rich soil and mulch it heavily with garden debris. <b>V. vitus-idaea</b>, the lingonberry. <b>V. caespitosum</b>, the dwarf bilberry. <b>V. gaultheriifolium</b>, the chinese blueberry. These and more have edible fruit. My primary interest in these species is identifying those that are most tolerant of my climate and variable soil conditions.</p><p><br></p><h3>Ziziphus Jujuba 'Jujube' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Fruit.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, cutting.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Supposed to be one of the easiest fruit trees to grow, tolerating most soil conditions.

This species shoul be very cold hardy. Wonderful plant that serves double duty as a fruit and vegetable. Fruits can be eaten fresh and pads should be cooked. Both fruit and pads have spines that must be removed, as well as invisible barbed hairs called glochids that are painful to the touch. Harvest with gloves or tongs and then thoroughly burn or scrub the entire pad. <b>O. cacanapa</b> is a bit less cold hardy but has larger pads. <b>O. stricta</b> should also be suitable for cold winters. The amount of spines differs between species and which variety you have. Many species have spineless varieties (they likely still have glochids though). All have amazing potential as an easy crop for poor soil, with the benefit of little wildlife pressure. Pads can be rooted easily, best to get these or live plants for a quick start. </p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/ovs4972oglnd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">These pads of O. humifosa were removed in winter and sent to me, which is not ideal but they will still do fine.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/1r0nsndclcu3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">They root very easily.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/cltp6l037091" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rooted pad growing a new pad.</a></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Bamboo</h2><p><br></p><h3>Chusquea Culeou 'Bamboo' | Perennial ⚫</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoots.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to part shade.

However, it can be challening to grow in hot climates as it prefers cooler weather. My strategy is to plant it in a shady area. There are not many references to this species being edible and it's not as common as other bamboos. <i>Bamboos: A Gardener's Guide To Their Cultivation In Temperate Climates</i> does indicate it is edible though. <b>C. gigantea </b>is also noteworthy as it produces one of the densest and thickest (1.75") canes of all cold hardy clumping bamboos. But it does spread much more than other clumping bamboos and does not seem to be edible.</p><p><br></p><h3>Fargesia Robusta 'Bamboo' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoots. </p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">EASY &amp; VIGOROUS</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>This clumping species is relatively tolerant of heat so it should be easier to cultivate in temperate climates. The canes reach a respectable diameter of 1". No clumping bamboo is going to provide as good of a harvest as a running bamboo in temperate climates, but it's better than nothing! And of course all bamboo species are great for using around the garden or generating mulch.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Ferns</h2><p><br></p><h3><b>Matteuccia Struthiopteris</b> 'Ostrich Fern' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoots.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, spore.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to part shade.

Traditionally it has been used externally for detoxifying viper bites - good to have it just in case I run into one, I guess. Currently it is used for cancer prevention and treatment. Most references indicate this plant is only used medicinally. <i>Plants For Human Consumption </i>mentions this species has an edible corm. I imagine this is referencing <i>Dictionary Of Economic Plants</i> which says the same. However in that listing it mentions the common name as 'Giant Taro' and this plant most certainly is not giant. So that has me curious if it is actually an accurate reference. In terms of edibility, this genus has one species of primary importance, <b>A. macrorrhizos</b>. This species is the true Giant Taro and is used for it's large corm after extremely thorough cooking.

I like the crimson variety for annual beds, after flowering it dies and gets out of the way. It will reseed itself to a degree but less when there is a lot of competition. The perennial species are great for meadows or fields. A patch of clover will attract bunnies, they often leave droppings so I consider it a very worthwhile trade!
