Not comprehensive, not a reference, only a starting point. Do not eat anything you are not 100% familiar with.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Useful methods of propagation. Usually seed, stem cutting, or rhizome/tuber.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Rough guidelines for minimum sun requirements. Deep shade (≈70%) → Shade (≈50%) → Part Shade (≈30%) → Sun (≈10%).</p><p><b>Wildlife:</b> Impact of wildlife on plant, particularly deer.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Everything else.

A thin and tall plant that doesn't create shade, so it is easy to grow in small gaps. Good pollinator and great seed production, should reseed itself easily. Useful herb for pickling.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Lavandula Angustifolia 'Lavender' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes:</b> Compact herb that grows similar to rosemary and is just as easily propagated. Limited culinary use but may be useful for its wonderful aroma when making hygiene products such as soap.</p><p><br></p><h3>Mentha spp. 'Mint' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Mentha requienii is the only species I've come across that forms a good groundcover. Others, like peppermint and spearmint, will grow taller and do well in almost any conditions. Not preferable for garden beds, may be better suited where it can be given space and managed easily. I put some spearmint in a compacted lawn with poor soil and mowed over it at least once, yet it still seems to be doing just fine. I like planting mints in shady spots as it slows down the growth and doesn't take space away from other plants that need more sun.</p><p><br></p><h3>Origanum Vulgare 'Oregano' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Low growing varieties make easy and useful ground covers, can spread a few feet in one season. Easy herb for shady areas. Greek variety better for culinary use but prefers more sun.</p><p><br></p><h3>Pycnanthemum spp. 'Mountain Mint' |  Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Similar to common mints but has a thinner leaf with a much more potent mint aroma/taste. Limited culinary usage but may be good in teas. May be useful for hygienic purposes, it is a good breath freshener. </p><p><br></p><h3>Salvia Rosmarinus 'Rosemary' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Prefers full sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes:</b> A compact herb with many culinary uses. Grows better in full sun but it will be fine in shadier areas, albeit a bit etiolated. Prefers well-drained soil but seems to be quite flexible. Propagation is easy, cut a few inches off the tip, remove some of the bottom leaves, place in water until roots form and then pot. From a single reasonably sized plant you could easily get a dozen cuttings over the course of one season, making it a great plant to put all over the garden if you plan to use it a lot.</p><p><br></p><h3>Salvia Verbenaca 'Sage' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Many varieties of sage plants can be eaten. This wild variety should be a vigorous grower. </p><p><br></p><h3>Thymus spp. 'Thyme' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Thymus vulgaris is the standard, grows similar to oregano, easy for culinary use. Thymus praecox is the creeping variety and forms a dense ground cover, may be preferable for filling in gaps between plants as it won't compete as much.</p><h2><br></h2><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Roots + Tubers</h2><p><br></p><h3>Althaea Officinalis 'Marshmallow' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Good potential as root crop although typically has more specific culinary uses than others on this list. Leaves and roots have good medicinal applications for relieving soar throat and coughs.</p><p><br></p><h3>Apios Americana 'Groundnut' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed. Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Grows easily and vigorously, spreading by rhizome, great for shady spots with something to climb on. Some varieties are bushier while some prefer to climb. There can be big differences in edible root size between varieties. Nitrogen fixer.</p><p><br></p><h3>Beta Trigyna 'Turkish Wild Beet' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>A little-known perennial alternative to the common beet. This species is said to have edible roots. Culinary appeal is uncertain.</p><p><br></p><h3>Codonopsis spp. 'Dang Shen' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. Protect early growth from heat and frost.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Many varieties with edible roots. Codonopsis Pilosula, chinese medicinal vine (Z7). Codonopsis Lanceolata, korean culinary vine (Z7). Codonopsis Bulleyana and Meleagris, hardy upright plant (Z4). Codonopsis Clematidea and Cardiophylla, hardy vine (Z4). Generally likes some shade as the young growth can be sensitive to heat and frost. Tubers grow larger every year, often harvested at 2-3 years old. Amazing potential as a root crop for the forest garden, especially the vining varieties. Plant dies back in winter, is not too aggressive and prefers its feet in the shade. All of this makes it a perfect candidate for climbing on bushes and trees without strangling them.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Dioscorea Polystachya 'Chinese Yam' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber, aerial tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, aerial tuber.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Aerial tubers can spread and propagate themselves easily, best planted in a spot where it cannot escape and where management is easy. Roots are fragile, should be grown in bag or tube that can be easily dug up without disturbing root. Plastic drainage pipes may work well when buried half-way into the ground, this is the method I will be trying. Root takes about 2-3 years to harvest, aerial tubers are good crop until then. If growing for aerial tubers, best to set aside some roots to leave in ground indefinitely, as older roots will produce more and larger aerial tubers. Needs a large trellis to climb on. Dioscorea japonica is the Japanese variety, fairly similar.</p><p><br></p><h3>Helianthus tuberosus 'Sunchoke' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, seed. Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Vigorous grower, great for poor soils. Best planted in a spot where it cannot escape and where management is easy. Roots contain large amounts of inulin. Keeping roots in ground during winter will help reduce this, as will certain methods of preparation (such as pickling/fermenting). May be useful as living barrier, some varieties can grow 10+ feet. Helianthus strumosus is grown similarly and has edible roots as well.</p><p><br></p><h3>Lepidium Meyenii 'Maca' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Can be difficult to grow outside of its native environment. Uncertain how long root can stay in ground.</p><p><br></p><h3>Oxalis Tuberosa 'Oca' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber, leaf, stem.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, stem, seed. Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Shelter from heat.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Tubers form during short days in late fall. Some varieties tuberize a week earlier, you may get better yields from these. Tubers may be overwintered in ground in Z7 and above, potential to move around garden. After sending up shoots in the spring, tuber will dissolve. Stems are tart and sour but edible, may be useful as perennial greens if you can find a good way to prepare them. Stems can be propagated easily, put them in some water and many roots will quickly form. This method of propagation may be useful for rapidly multiplying potted plants before the season starts.</p><p><br></p><h3>Platycodon Grandiflorus 'Balloon Flower' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>It appears only some varieties are used for edible root production. The root is called toraji, so look for this when purchasing. In the same family as Codonopsis species, will produce edible roots in a similar fashion. Upright growth.</p><p><br></p><h3>Psoralea Esculenta 'Breadroot' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Will take 2-3 years until harvest similar to Chinese yam and codonopsis, but mature root size looks to be much smaller. Nitrogen fixer.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Raphanus Sativus 'Radish' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in sun. Useful cover crop for breaking up and improving hard soil if left in ground to decompose.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Solanum spp. 'Potato' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, seed. Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive. I think the chipmunk has dug a few up.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Establishing a perennial potato patch poses two main problems: disease pressure builds up over the years and tubers may not survive a winter dormancy when left in the ground. Wild potatoes do not suffer from these problems because they are often resistant to both disease and frost, but many wild potatoes are either not safe to eat and/or difficult to harvest. Wild potatoes are also able to spread multiple feet each year via tubers attached to long stolons, allowing them to move around as they grow. Domestication has made potaotes more stationary and more edible but has also weakened their resistances. Finding domesticated species that maintain some of their wild genetics while still being easy to harvest and edible seems to be the best way to incorporate perennial potato patches into forest gardens. Allowing the tubers to move around the garden will also likely significantly improve disease resistance, as they won't be stuck in the same patch of soil year after year. Some species form tubers during short days in fall and some are day-neutral. Short day potatoes are less productive and have a limited harvest window, but for those same reasons may also be less prone to wildlife interference. Solanum Curtilobum and&nbsp;Solanum Ajanhuiri have good frost-resistance and dormancy, so I will be attempting to establish perennial patches of these.</p><p><br></p><h3>Stachys Affinis 'Chinese Artichoke' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy and vigorous root crop, spreading by rhizomes. Beautiful small tubers that overwinter easily after top dies back. One of the smaller tubers on this list but should produce a good amount of them without any attention.</p><p><br></p><h3>Ullucus tuberosus 'Ulloco' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Shelter from heat.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Tubers form during short days in late fall. Tubers may be overwintered in ground, potential to move around garden. Difficult to grow in hot weather. Leaves can be used like spinach, may be useful as perennial greens. Tubers are supposedly hardier than oca and should survive Z7 winters easily.</p><h2><br></h2><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Onions</h2><p><br></p><h3>Allium Cepa Aggregatum 'Potato Onion' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, seed. Seed takes a while to get going.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>In same cultivar group as common shallots but slightly different properties, can grow larger and store longer, may be better suited for perennial patches. Most varieties will not set seed and propagation by bulb is easiest. Green mountain should be a high-yielding variety. Potato onions or walking onions would be my first choices when choosing which onions to grow.</p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Cepa Proliferum 'Walking Onion' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf, bulbet.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, bulbet.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to propagate, simply toss bulbets around garden or divide the bulbs at the base of the plant. Varieties with larger bulbets may be preferable if using them directly as food, there seems to be noticeable differences in bulbet size between some varieties. Some varieties have sharper tasting leaves than others. Does not do well with too much shade.</p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Fistulosum 'Bunching Onion' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Useful as another form of scallion, will multiple easily and patches can be divided for propagation. Best to find varieties that are suitably cold hardy for your climate in order to establish a perennial patch. </p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Oschaninii 'True Shallot' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>The only true shallot, originally found growing wild in China. Not the same as Allium Cepa, which are also referred to as shallots. Good potential for perennial patch.</p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Sativum 'Garlic' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf, bulbet.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, bulbet.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to propagate via bulbs or aerial bulbets, although the bulbets will take longer to produce a good crop. Varieties collected in the wild may be better suited for establishing perennial patches, but as with all garlic this will lead to smaller bulbs and more disease pressure. </p><h2><br></h2><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Vegetables</h2><p><br></p><h3>Beta Vulgaris Maritima | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Unlike Beta Trigyna, this perennial beet relative is grown for its edible leaves. Some reports indicate the root is edible as well. I have yet to see anyone harvest the root, I will have to try it for myself. Leaves should be tasty.</p><p><br></p><h3>Brassica Oleracea 'Kale' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, inflorescence.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Stem, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Will grow in shade but gets leggy.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant, except in winter. Bunnies nibble on leaves, but typically don't damage more than a few. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Perennial grex provides good variety, option to select for desirable traits. Thicker leafed plants less sensitive to insects, although may be less palatable. Susceptible to cabbage worm. Should be spaced apart to prevent crowding (plants can spread 3 feet in diameter) and limit insect spread. Should be interplanted with trap crops and pollinator plants to minimize damage. Despite the wildlife and insect pressure, plants always seem to bounce back just fine. To propogate by stem simply place it in some water until roots form (may take a while) and then pot it.</p><p><br></p><h3>Brassica Rapa var Purpurea 'Hon Tsai Tai' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, stem, inflorescence.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Fast growing, self-seeding and easy to get established. Bolts from heat but should be able to get two successive crops. Great potential as easy and productive vegetable.</p><p><br></p><h3>Bunias Orientalis 'Turkish Rocket' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoots, leaf, inflorescence.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Young shoots with leaves and inflorescence can be eaten like rapini. Easy to grow and propogate. Useful perennial vegetable for the choice flowerheads that appear every year. The closest you'll get to a perennial broccoli. Propagates easily by seed, great staple crop for the garden.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Chenopodium Bonus-Henricus 'Good King Henry' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, inflorescence.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Perennial spinach alternative. Young inflorescence edible as well. Produces lots of seed and propagates easily.</p><p><br></p><h3>Colocasia Esculenta 'Taro' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Corm, stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Corm.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to shade. Wet soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Stems provide wonderful, spongy perennial vegetable unlike anything else. All part of plant contain calcium oxalate, so must be cooked thoroughly to be safe to eat. Preparation varies, best to do research beforehand. Useful for wet and shady areas. Some varieties are cold hardy to Z7 and perhaps lower. Can grow over 5 feet tall, good potential to be interpolated with shade-tolerant vining plants that can climb on its long stems (perhaps groundnut, codonopsis or jiaogulan).</p><p><br></p><h3>Glebionis Coronaria 'Shungiku' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, stem, flower bud.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Fast growing, self-seeding and easy to get established. Great potential as easy and productive vegetable. Milder flavored varieties better suited as vegetable.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Gynostemma pentaphyllum 'Jiaogulan' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Good herb/leafy vegetable for shady spots, great potential for food forest. Most reports discuss the medicinal benefits of drinking as a tea, but it seems the leaves can also just be eaten as a vegetable or a potherb. Not very cold hardy, will see if it survives here. Unclear if a single plant can produce seed.</p><p><br></p><h3>Hosta spp. 'Hosta' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive. Unlikely they would eat the shoots though.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Many varieties but only some historically used for vegetables. Supposedly all are edible but probably best to get the well known varieties if not interested in experimenting. Young shoots (and very young leaves) make unique vegetables, cut once and then allow plant to grow. Tolerant of most conditions. Useful for deep shade where edible options are limited.</p><p><br></p><h3>Petasites Japonicus 'Japanese Butterbur' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, flower bud.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Plant has toxic alkaloids, eat in moderation and always prepare according to traditional methods. Can be an aggressive spreader once established, plant where it will not escape and can be easily managed. Useful for wet and shady areas, similar conditions as taro. Petasites japonicus var. giganteus is a larger variety, growing taller with wider leaves, affect on edible yield is uncertain. Related to Petasites frigidus, arctic butterbur, which has edible properties as well.</p><p><br></p><h3>Rumex Alpinus 'Alpine Dock' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>In the same genus as common sorrel, but this plant produces much larger leaves with a more striking appearance. Should produce a larger yield than common sorrel as well. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Field Crop + Seed</h2><p><br></p><h3>Amaranthus spp. 'Amaranth' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, one of their favorites. Birds enjoy seeds?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. Reseeds itself generously, even without reaching maturity. Plants consistenly eaten by deer still produced enough seed to self sow. Seed is easy to harvest and clean, but are small and dense compared to other grains. Some varieties are better for seed production, others are better for edible leaves. May not be best for garden bed as it can get weedy, perhaps better suited for a field with other grain crops.</p><p><br></p><h3>Atriplex Hortensis 'Orach' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, one of their favorites.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. Reseeds itself generously. Good species for leaf production, easy spinach substitute.</p><p><br></p><h3>Celosia Argentea 'Plumed Cockscomb' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. Reseeds itself generously. All reports indicate leaves must be cooked. Gorgeous flowers, some reports of young inflorescence being eaten but the specifics of that may depend on the variety. A few different varieties, some growing taller than others. Celosia trigyna is said to have edible leaves as well but is not worth growing.</p><p><br></p><h3>Chenopodium Nuttalliae 'Huauzontle' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, inflorescence, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, one of their favorites.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. Reseeds itself generously. Unlike other related species, this plant is often used for its edible inflorescence. As far as edible inflorescence production goes, this plant has amazing potential both for it's ease of growth and the quantity a single patch can produce. </p><p><br></p><h3>Helianthus Annuus 'Sunflower' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Flower, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant. Birds enjoy seeds?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. Large edible seeds. The young, unopened flower head can be prepared and eaten as a vegetable similar to artichoke/cardoon heart. Great potential as vegetable, especially for multi-headed varieties. Some have multiple smaller flowers and some have a single large flower. Plants can grow over 10 feet, should make an excellent trellis or barrier.</p><p><br></p><h3>Sorghum Bicolor 'Sorghum' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant. Birds enjoy seeds?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. One of the easiest grain to process for backyard gardeners. Leaf structure creates little shade and makes it a good plant for vines to climb on, similar to maize. Stalks can be left in ground after plant dies - potential use as trellis or barrier in the next season. Varieties differ in days to maturity, faster-maturing varieties more suitable for temperate climates.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
