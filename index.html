<h1>Food For The Extinction</h1><p><i>The 6th mass extinction is here. Climate collapse is unstoppable. Civilization can no longer sustain us. Research into resilient crops and natural cultivation methods for food security in temperate climates. This page is a work in progress and all information may not be accurate.</i></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>A Path Forward</h2><p>Everyday I ask myself, what should I do? As our planet barrels towards an uninhabitable future, our governments become more repressive and everyday life becomes more dystopian, what can I do to stop all this? The most important realization is that none of us are going to change the world. We are not going to save the planet from another extinction (it's already happening). We are not going to save the billions of human and non-human lives that will perish. Already over 80 billion land animals are killed each year for consumption, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Words cannot do justice to the absolutely immense horrors we are responsible for. Clinging to some vision of a better future is tempting, but the evidence against this couldn't be more obvious. The destructive power of civilization has been growing for thousands of years now. Behind all the lies about progress is the simple truth: our planet is dying and there is nothing we, as individuals, can do about it. And so we are perhaps one of the few generations of humans to live through the momentous shift climate collapse is causing. Nothing like this has ever happened in the entire history of humanity. Mankind is entering a new era.</p><p>In the face of all this, how can I be of any meaningful service? Why spend my time researching and growing food? I believe having an interactive relationship with nature is one of the most direct ways to feel satisfied and empowered. And only individuals engaged with nature are capable of forming communities that truly provide for our physical, social and spiritual needs. When our empire inevitably collapses, these communities have the potential to be the building blocks of a new society, to form a federation of self-sufficient tribes. Keeping land at the forefront of both individual and societal success is an effective path forward because it is meaningful at every level - whether you just want to not hate the world, or you want to improve the living conditions of your community, or you want to build a new society. Even disregarding the bigger picture, this perspective is nothing but practical. How will you feed your family when industrial agriculture fails or groceries become too expensive to afford? Growing food is a concrete way of solving a very real and imminent problem without depending on people who don't care about us or our planet. There's nothing glamorous about this, it's hands in the dirt kind of change, but it's real and it happens right before your eyes. </p><p>Growing food doesn't have to be hard, lots of vegetables even grow like weeds! Grass lawns were once a symbol of wealth, yet now they sit in front of even the most impoverished homes. This paradox was intentionally designed through generations of propaganda. For years I was utterly confused, why are some vegetables considered to grow too well and eradicated while right next door people go hungry? Is there an abundance of food or isn't there!? I will leave you to answer this yourself, but either way it certainly doesn't have to be this way. Only within the last few decades did we gain access to thousands of seeds from every corner of the earth. Consider how many generations of work went into finding, domesticating and improving these crops throughout human history! This is a privilege few could even dream of until now. As the world transforms into something entirely new, it has in the very same moment bestowed upon us the plants of salvation. And with them comes the power to create a landscape unlike any before in history. I have a vision for a garden that is a meadow, orchard, and forest all in one. Food is everywhere, underneath your feet, brushing past your knees, blossoming towards the sky and hanging from the trees. A garden that draws all creatures towards it, a garden that fills them up and envelopes them. A garden that provides for everyone within it while magically regenerating, becoming stronger and more complex every year.</p><p>On a more practical note, this research is an attempt to prepare for the extinction and help communities build resilient food systems. Most people have land with poor soil and very little knowledge about growing food. Finding crops that can grow in this environment and provide real sustenance is therefore of the utmost importance. Ultimately all this may accomplish very little, but every day that a garden lives it serves the creatures within. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Nevertheless, a new breed of explorers has arisen, those who are disenchanted with the bland products of the supermarkets, those who still feel the primordial urge to plant, those whose tastes are adventurous. There are those whose pocketbooks are thin who can benefit from green leaves easily grown at home. Finally, there are the few who recognize that the vegetables we emphasize now are but a part of a larger, and mostly still available heritage, a heritage whose potentials have still not been fully realized.</i></p><p><i>- Edible Leaves Of The Tropics </i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>The Plants We Eat</h2><p>How do we even begin to feed ourselves? What are we growing and eating? I personally do not grow nearly enough food to feed myself. It is a difficult task that most people throughout most of history have not attempted. Even after the advent of agriculture, a significant portion of food was often foraged from the local environment. But the natural abundance that once covered the earth has been almost completely destroyed. As agriculture evolved to power an ever-expanding civilization, forests were felled and landscapes were permanently disfigured. We burned down ecosystems masterfully designed over millennia, teeming with life and full of nutritious food, in an attempt to grow something a fraction as productive in their place, all with big clumsy hands and little human brains. The plants that sprouted in these graveyards were not grown for people, but markets and masters; they could not nourish us in the same way. All this is only to say that growing all of our own food in a truly compassionate and sustainable way requires a monumental, persistent effort and has not been the norm for any period of human history. But the old world is gone and it is never coming back, so we must do what we can given our circumstances. Growing only a portion of our food still has enormous benefits and can certainly create some sense of food security, even if it is not complete. So returning to our original question, what should we grow? What plants do people eat to survive? </p><p>The broadest pattern that emerges for practically any species on earth is the foods that provide the highest net energy and nutrition (and are digestible by the specific anatomy of the creature) in any given landscape become primary sources of sustenance. That means a guerilla that has access to fruits will generally prioritize those over leaves. Eating 20 pounds of fruit is much easier than eating 20 pounds of leaves. And like many other mammals, humans gravitate towards high-density sources of energy like nuts, fruits, roots and seeds to sustain themselves. Leafy vegetables, while an essential addition to our diet, require a much larger quantity to provide the same amount of energy. </p><p>This happens to work out quite well for us because nuts and fruits are some of the easiest, most productive perennial crops. Even with a limited amount of space we have many options, including hazelnut, plum and mulberry. Once planted, they can often continue producing for decades - talk about a return on investment! Tree crops also require significantly less resources to produce, meaning they will often tolerate poorer soil and less frequent watering than many herbaceous crops. In this way they are extremely efficient at producing food. The benefits of trees are truly endless and there is no easier way to improve the health of a landscape. Fruit and nut trees are therefore the first priority for us and can make up a significant portion of our diet. </p><p>Root crops are also a very dense source of energy, often more so than fruit. They usually require more work, however, as soil may need to be built up and the crops must be regularly propagated, either by seed or division. Cold-hardy, perennial root crops usually need at least 2 years of growth before harvest. This includes plants like groundnut and doraji. However, given the right growing conditions some can be harvested every year like the sunchoke. While perennial roots are more work than simply picking fruit off a tree, they usually require little maintenance once planted. Annual roots may require more work to grow, but can significantly expand our options with some heavy hitters like achira, taro or potato. Alongside nuts and fruits, roots are another significant addition to our diet. </p><p>Our next consideration is the smallest of the bunch: seeds. When people grow all their own food, seeds are usually how they do it. Seeds, including grains and pulses, are very calorically dense, can be eaten in quantity, and are easily stored or transported. This is why almost every civilization on earth has been built on them. But growing grains sustainably can be difficult - most often it results in a monoculture that degrades the soil while providing very little ecological value. And to top it all off, grains require the most labor of any food mentioned here to grow, harvest and process. This is not to say they should be avoided, only that how they are grown and incorporated into our diet needs to be reconsidered. Pulses can also be a valuable addition for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil and help other crops grow. But even so, this category of foods is generally comprised of labor-intensive annuals that are difficult to incorporate into more permanent food systems. Ultimately it may be useful to think of seeds, grains, and pulses as another addition to a varied diet, and not necessarily the staple of every meal. </p><p>Finally, we arrive at leafy vegetables and the like. While they don't provide the bulk of our sustenance, they are necessary for vitamins and minerals (and flavor!). They also bring diversity and excitement to the garden. Here too we can focus on perennials that provide a crop every year with almost no effort after the initial planting. Plants like good king henry, turkish rocket and seombadi provide excellent perennial alternatives to some of the more common vegetables you may be used to eating. Succulents like prickly pear or dolnamul can turn barren land with very little fertility into an oasis of fresh food. Plants that generate a lot of biomass like udo can offer us regular harvests while producing organic matter for mulching. Weedy annuals like perilla can compete with other vegetation and turn unproductive land into a thicket of food in a single season. The options are truly limitless, and every plant has its own unique traits that can be utilized to our advantage.</p><p>The food we choose to grow is also fundamentally related to how we eat. If we only eat a few times per day, each meal needs to be extremely calorically dense, further deepening our reliance on grains. But what if we ate more like the guerilla? It's a lot easier to eat five pounds of fruits and nuts over the course of an entire day than it is to eat it at only three meals. Maybe changing what we eat also means changing how we eat.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Working With Nature</h2><p>The methods I use all fit into a singular holistic approach - working with natural systems to incorporate food crops into the landscape. The plants are our teachers. This mean learning from them without any preconceived notions about how they should grow or what they should be doing. We are watching and listening, not expecting. It is absolutely essential that we approach this with a sense of humility, respect, and the recognition that plants are complex and intelligent living beings. We will never understand the endless layers of nuance that guide their growth, but lucky for us we don't need to. All we need to do is listen closely and offer our service.</p><p>Healthy soil is the backbone of temperate food forests, and plants are natural soil builders. Plants build soil using a few primary methods. Sending roots into the soil adds organic matter, cycles nutrients, aerates the soil and gives it structure. This builds soil from within. After the plants die, their stems and leaves fall over and act as mulch until they fully decompose. Dead plants keep the soil from drying out, return nutrients to the topsoil and offer a sheltered microclimate for everything happening at ground level. It is often the case that soil already has enough of everything it needs, we just need to help make it bioavailable by cycling it through plants and turning it into into mulch. This builds soil from above. And the way plants naturally die and return to the ground creates a thick but not overly dense layer of mulch. Most importantly, it has structure. It allows space for other seeds to germinate and grow while still offering shelter from the elements. When one plant dies it creates the right environment for the next plant to take its spot, to work the soil with its roots, and then to become mulch for the next plant. This is the genius of nature. </p><p>So our two most important methods of building soil are using the power of roots to work the soil, and returning organic matter back to the topsoil as mulch. In the garden we can imitate these patterns by letting plants cover as much ground as possible. The more roots we have working the soil for us, the better. Of course, we can't let every single plant grow to maturity or else there would be no room for our food crops. This is where we come in. We can curate which plants to let grow and which to cut down. Instead of ripping everything up and dumping an even mat of mulch on our beds, we can build the soil more naturally. By cutting down plants in the garden and using them as mulch, we are imitating a natural soil-building pattern.</p><p>Encouraging plants to cover the soil and continuously decompose has added benefits as well. First, it creates the right environment for insects. Bugs need a diverse landscape with a variety of physical niches to take advantage of. They don't like flat sheets of mulch. If we didn't have the right balance of insects, we would constantly be fighting against them. This method of management invites them all in to sort it out amongst themselves. The insects can then become our partners as primary decomposers of dead plants, continuously adding fertility to the soil. Second, it creates the right environment for beneficial fungal networks. Plants depend on fungi to survive and thrive. The more roots they can partner with and the more organic matter we can feed them, the better. </p><p>Practically, implementing this system is fairly straightforward because we are letting nature do most of the work for us. There will be a host of plants growing in our garden beds whether we like it or not. If any plants are competing too much with our food crops, we just cut them down and let them fall where they are. The more aggressive the species is the more often those plants will need to be removed. If we let them grow they may create too much shade or spread too aggressively. But the species that present little competition to our food crops need less management. Some of them may be edible themselves, some may attract beneficial insects, some may fix nitrogen, some may protect the soil. We are looking at the ground and seeing which plants are working for us and which ones aren't. Those that aren't get ripped up and now they are working for us as mulch! </p><p>As an example, in my garden beds I allow many plants to grow, some of which are: <i>Duchesnea indica [mock strawberry] </i>acts as a non-invasive groundcover;<i> Trifolium repens [white clover] </i>and any other leguminous plants fix nitrogen; <i>Lobelia inflata [Indian tobacco] </i>is a native medicinal; <i>Stellaria media [chickweed]</i> is a delicous edible; <i>Zinnia peruviana [Peruvian zinnia] </i>is a beautiful flower appreciated by local pollinators. There are also many that I rip up and mulch in place with as often as possible: <i>Muhlenbergia schreberi [nimblewill]</i> or any other weedy grasses spread quickly by rhizome and discourage vegetable seed germination; <i>Erechtites hieraciifolius [American burnweed], Acalypha rhomboidea [copperleaf], </i>and<i> Persicaria maculosa [lady's thumb] </i>all multiply rapidly by seed and can easily take over garden beds. It is always helpful to watch how a plant interacts with the its environment before running to rip it up. There are even cases where it may be beneficial to let a weed grow to maturity, allowing its roots to improve the soil, before cutting it down and using all the biomass it created as mulch. Even a plant like lady's thumb may be useful in the right circumstance; when regenerating a patch of eroded soil, this was one of of the main plants to start growing once the ground had been stabilized. It's ability to grow quickly practically anywhere is now helping stabilize the ground with its roots, add organic matter, create shade for the topsoil and shelter for insects. It will eventually be replaced by other plants with my assistance, but for now it is doing me a lot of good. In this case, it is working for me and not against me. There is no right or wrong here, just fluid and spontaneous responses to what's in front of us. Natural processes are constantly working towards a healthier ecosystem and are ultimately doing the vast majority of work for us. Our role is not to redefine these processes, but use them to guide the environment towards productivity and diversity. </p><p>This system works particularly well for beds with annuals and biennials that rely on seed dispersal for their continued survival. A thick layer of mulch would lock in moisture but prevent the dispersed seeds from germinating. A thin layer of mulch would allow the seeds to germinate but dry the soil out. But mulching in place with local plants creates a structured mulch that is thick enough to lock in moisture but open and aerated enough for germinating seeds to grow. Creating the right environment in those first 6 inches above the soil through selective weeding and mulching in place is essential for short-lived plants to naturally grow and propagate themselves. This system also allows us to work within a sustainable, closed loop. We are not depending on mulch or soil delivered from somewhere else, everything we need is being grown right on our own land. We are not importing fertility, we are building it.</p><p>In addition to building soil naturally, we can also imitate how plants naturally disperse seed. Direct seeding right into the ground is effective and produces high germination rates, but there are drawbacks. If all the seedlings germinate at roughly the same time, they are all subject to identical conditions during identical phases of growth. If a dry spell occurs right after germination and the seedlings are not drought tolerant enough, they will all die unless they are watered. Or slugs may come through and eat them. Or a heavy downpour may damage them. Or it may be too sunny and they'll get scorched. Any number of things could happen to affect them. Essentially, by forcing them to grow in a certain place at a certain time, the whole population is now entirely dependent on you. But when seeds are naturally dispersed through whatever mechanism the plant uses, they tend to grow in slightly different circumstances. Many will not germinate at all, some will sit on a leaf until being knocked over a few months later, some will get moved around by the birds. Some will germinate and die because of the weather or because they landed in the wrong niche. Some will rot, some will get eaten. Only a small percentage of them will grow to maturity - this is natural, and this is why plants produce so many seeds (hundreds or thousands). But even though the rate of germination is much lower, the resiliency of that population is much higher. So whenever possible we are imitating the natural dispersal of seeds and encouraging them to germinate intermittently in different conditions. For most annuals or biennials, the pattern is fairly similar: help the plant propagate itself without getting in the way. We are giving power back to the seeds by letting them decide when to germinate and how to grow - our job is only to create the right environment for them to do it. </p><p>For annuals or biennials this method requires a lot of seed. A single plant can produce thousands of seeds, but in any given season less than a dozen may grow to maturity (this will vary based on the plant and how favorable the local environment is). Unfortunately, most seed packets come with comparatively few seeds. So our first generation should be grown in more carefully managed conditions and cared for until they go to seed. This will get the plant acquainted with our local conditions while increasing our seed count to something more realistic. Once we have have hundreds or thousands of fresh seeds, these can then be dispersed more naturally into the garden beds and allowed to grow on their own. The soil is now functioning as our seed bank - every year we are depositing more and more seeds into it that will then wait for the right opportunity to germinate and grow. With every successive generation, the plants will be better acclimated to this specific method and will grow more easily. And as the amount of seeds in the soil increases, we can spend less time weeding because our food crops will be able to compete better and cover more ground.  </p><p>We must remember that seeds and plants are intelligent, responsive living beings. They understand the particulars of every patch of soil. They understand the nuances of weather. In many ways they are much smarter than us. With my human eyes and hands I can only know so much about the soil. If one of us has to decide where and when to grow, it should be them. As a human I do, of course, have certain strengths: weeding, mulching, loosening and building soil, dispersing seed, landscaping. My arms help create a favorable environment for the crops, and my legs help disperse their seed in the right spot. But I don't bother trying to control their growth because this is what they are good at and I would only be getting in their way! It is a beautiful thing to partner with a plant. Honor that relationship and only good things can come. </p><p>Even with all the help we provide, some plants will simply not be suited for our soil or climate without a lot of work. So it's just as important to find the right species or varieties for our specific conditions. We can't expect to drop any old plant in and have it grow! This is why our plant selection prioritizes resiliency, and those that do survive become become stronger with every generation. Before long the food will be growing itself. Of course, regular maintenance is unavoidable. In order to grow certain plants we must halt the process of succession - otherwise our garden would quickly become a deciduous forest (at least where I live). Incorporating tree crops helps us work with succession to a certain degree, but ultimately there is no way to avoid the basic work of weeding, transplanting and dispersing seeds. Every garden requires maintenance, but this method aligns our efforts with natural processes and allows us to intervene only when it is meaningful. This is not a step by step plan with a full proof outcome. This is a dance.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>On Invasives</h2><p>Invasive plants are not well defined. Generally they are considered plants which are non-native and cause some form of disruption to the local environment. Typically this refers to the non-native plant displacing natives or preventing natives from growing and propagating in their normal manner. This is usually seen as a bad thing because non-native plants do not have the same diverse set of ecological functions that many natives do. Invasives usually cannot support the rich web of life that has spent thousands of years evolving alongside native plants. This is one of the reasons why so much time and energy is spent trying to get rid of them (along with a healthy amount of corporate propaganda, of course).</p><p>But realistically, we are not going to eradicate invasives and restore native ecosystems to their former glory on any meaningful scale. Our society is simply not prepared to accomplish such a monumental feat. What is happening right now, the widespread exchange of plants across the world, must be seen in the context of the ongoing extinction due to climate collapse. Our world is changing, and so is our flora. The 'invasives' are here to stay, and it's about time we get our heads out of the sand. In thousands of years, what we consider invasive plants will become native plants to an entirely different ecology. This is the start of a vastly different evolutionary timeline, as has been the case after every great extinction to happen on earth.</p><p>Once we accept that invasives are not going anywhere, the question then becomes: how can we work with them and use them to our advantage? Clearly eradicating them is not possible. And letting them run wild will just result in a big tangled mess with very little biodiversity. But we can treat them just like any other plant in our garden and learn how to manage them thoughtfully, taking advantage of their unique traits to help restore the landscape. </p><p>Invasives are some of the toughest, most efficient plants out there. They can grow on degraded land, generate tons of carbon and put roots in soil faster than many other plants. Not to mention how smart they are at rapidly propagating themselves. These are amazing and useful qualities, and some of them even produce high-quality food! In the face of climate collapse, mass ecological destruction, and worsening food scarcity, invasives are a unique set of plants we can't afford to ignore.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Rewilding Vegetables</h2><p>All of the vegetables we grow in the garden were once plants growing the wild, surviving on their own without any help from humans. They drank only rain water and took what nutrients they needed from the soil. They produced seed which then went on to germinate and grow of its own accord, again without any help from humans. So why must gardening be so complicated? Why do we struggle to grow plants that often grow prolifically when left alone in their natural habitat? Here are three perspectives to approach this from:</p><p><br></p><p><b>Breeding:</b> Many annuals and biennials have been bred for hundreds or thousands of years, and they are no longer adapted to thrive in the face of competition and scarce natural resources. Generations of selection have weakened many of their natural responses to disease and browsing. </p><blockquote><i>Approach: Select for specimens that can thrive with little care and let go of those that cannot. This will lead to a resilient population capable of propagating itself.</i></blockquote><p><br></p><p><b>Environment:</b> Plants evolve alongside their environment, carving out unique niches in which they can successfully grow and propagate themselves. We can move a plant from the wilderness to our gardens, but we cannot move the landscape, climate, wildlife and the endless number of other, unknown variables.</p><blockquote><i>Approach: Acclimate crops to a new environment by creating favorable growing conditions and weeding selectively. As the plants evolve, so should your management practices.</i></blockquote><p><br></p><p><b>Density:</b> Even when a crop has been bred for resiliency and is well-adapted to our local environment, we are usually still attempting to grow it at a much higher density than would naturally be the case. Healthy soil that can support our crops depends on a diversity of plants in constant evolution with one another. </p><blockquote><i>Approach: Grow a diverse variety of crops alongside each other to lower the density of any given species, keep soil healthy, and encourage a balanced insect population.</i></blockquote><p><br></p><p>This three-pronged approach helps me understand the vegetables I grow in a broader context and offers a simple framework for growing crops in a way that becomes both easier and more sustainable over time. Keep in mind that naturalizing vegetables in the garden can be a long process and may take many years. Many vegetables will simply not be suited to grow naturally in your specific climate and soil. The weeds that grow naturally in your area can provide some insight as to what families of plants will grow easily, but if often comes down to lots of trial and error.</p><p>I find many online references about certain vegetables self-sowing to be completely inaccurate in my garden. I think they are often referring to beds that are kept clean, regularly cleared back to bare soil and irrigated. In these conditions pretty much anything will self-sow if you let it go to seed. Living ground covers, mulching in place, weed competition and reliance on rainwater leads to different results in my experience. Wild vegetables or those that have had minimal breeding work will often do better in these conditions. But whether the plants we grow are wild or domesticated, they need to move in the direction of self-growing, self-propagating genetics that are adapted to intense competition and unpredictable rainfall. I am convinced this is the only meaningful direction for the future that lies ahead of us.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Plant Management</h2><p>I am always trying to get as close to natural patterns as I can - the less I have to intervene, the better. Of course, the ideal form of natural farming may not always be the most practical. Below I have laid out some of the defining characteristics of two different management patterns. Both would be considered natural farming but they differ in many important ways.</p><p><br></p><table tableid="066664da" columns="2" style="--columns: 2; --rows: 14;" rows="14" class=""><tr><td class=""><b>Fluid </b></td><td class=""><b>Rigid</b></td></tr><tr><td class=""><i>Human management integrating with natural patterns.</i></td><td class=""><i>Human management interfering with natural patterns.</i></td></tr><tr><td class="">Crop growth and soil regeneration occur simultaneously.</td><td class="">Crop growth and soil regeneration occur separately. </td></tr><tr><td class="">Crops selected based on local conditions.</td><td class="">Crops selected based on human preference.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Weeds grow alongside vegetables.</td><td class="">Weeds mainly grow during fallow periods.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Competitive weeds are mulched in place.</td><td class="">All weeds are mulched in place or composted.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Beds are never cleared or reset.</td><td class="">Beds are cleared and reset before every planting.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Fluid and natural crop rotation.</td><td class="">Rigid and scheduled crop rotation.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Seeds are stored alongside each other in the soil.</td><td class="">Seeds are collected, cleaned, and stored separately.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Seeds are dispersed naturally as they appear.</td><td class="">Seeds are sown before expected germination.</td></tr><tr><td class="">No control over when crops germinate and grow.</td><td class="">Control over when crops germinate and grow.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Polycultures are formed spontaneously.</td><td class="">Polycultures are intentionally organized.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Vegetables are harvested as needed.</td><td class="">Vegetables are harvested all at once.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Perennials grow alongside annuals.</td><td class="">Perennials mainly grow separate from annuals.</td></tr></table><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Water Management</h2><p>Water is the foundation of life and there are a variety of simple modifications we can make to our land in order to help slow rainwater down and sink it into the soil. This is usually accomplished by either removing soil to create a depression, adding soil to create a mound, or most often a combination of the two. In some cases this may remove or drastically reduce the need for irrigation. </p><p>These methods revolve around a few simple and fundamental functions: a) slowing or concentrating water to infiltrate into the soil and raise the surrounding water table while b) simultaneously catching sediment or debris and revegetating so that c) the landscape can hold has much water as possible underground, in the soil, aboveground and in a dense canopy of vegetation. </p><p>Many methods can be found at <a href="https://www.greener.land" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Greener Land</a> and most can be done on a small scale with nothing but a shovel, so don't be intimidated! <a href="https://ananas.design/journal/2019/4/23/how-to-prepare-your-land-before-the-monsoons" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">This page</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);"> </span>also has some nice illustrations.

Below I have summarized some of the most relevant methods.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Terrace</b> | <i>Steep Slope</i></p><p>One of the most labor intensive methods but effective for leveling land with steep slopes. I think it usually makes more sense to adjust your plant selection so they can be planted on contour right into the slope and then use other landscaping methods or plants where the land levels out. There are very casual ways of making small terraces (as seen in the first link) and more effective, long term solutions involving laying down stone in particular patterns. The Incas are believed to have tailored their tuber cultivation to different microclimates within sunken, circular terraces. Talk about advanced agriculture! <a href="https://www.tenthacrefarm.com/quick-terrace-hill/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Link]</a></p><p><br></p><p><b>Net &amp; Pan</b> | <i>Steep to Low Slope</i></p><p>This system is surprisingly rare given how useful it can be in the right situation. It consists of digging shallow trenches around trees and connecting them with narrow pathways to guide water. This solution is helpful in two scenarios. The first being when trees are already established and any significant digging or soil movement has the potential to damage tree roots close to the surface. The second being when the slope of the land is too steep for swales or other interventions. The term 'net and pan' has also been used to describe negarim and boomerang basins. The key concept shared by these patterns is that water is collected within a single module and any overflow is passed along to another module within the network. However I have described those two methods separately below. <a href="https://bogatasuma.eu/permaculture-net_and_pan_orchard.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Link]</a></p><p><br></p><p><b>Bamboo Fence</b> | <i>Steep to Low Slope</i></p><p>Arranged on contour, a primitive bamboo fence will help slow water down and can be applied to steep or gently sloped terrain. The bamboo also acts as a channel allowing rainwater to penetrate deeper into the soil. The bamboo should be treated beforehand to prevent rot and then hammered into the ground until it is secure. The smaller the gap between individual stakes the better. Since bamboo can grow so quickly and there are suitable species for most environments, it seems smart to develop more water-harvesting methods that utilize it. Stones and logs are not always available but bamboo is strong, lightweight and can be grown on the spot.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Contour Swale</b> | <i>Moderate to Low Slope</i></p><p>A popular water management solution and effective on both very large and very small scales. It consists of digging trenches along the contour of a slope (so that the trench is level as it curves around the landscape) and piling the dug up soil into a mound behind the trench. This helps catch, sink and redirect rainwater along with any sediment or soil it is carrying. Logs (or even stones) can be buried within the mounds Hügelkultur style to lift them higher and improve the soil. Swales can also be dug off countour to direct water in a specific direction if needed. Off-contour swales are also better for steeper slopes where slowing and directing rainwater is more practical than trying to completely stop its momentum. Even if the slope is too steep for a swale, perennials can still be planted on contour to help slow down water and reduce erosion. <a href="https://midwestpermaculture.com/2012/07/hugelkultured-swale-with-linear-food-forest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Link]</a></p><p><br></p><p><b>Pond</b> | <i>Moderate to Low Slope</i></p><p>Ponds are often the foundation of water management systems, allowing long-term water storage and distribution. Higher elevation siting is typically preferred to make use of gravity for irrigation further downslope. Ponds are often used in conjunction with other methods like contour swales and terraces. And as with contour swales or any other interventions that concentrate large amounts of water, thoughtfully designed spillways are essential for long term sustainability and safety. Ponds can be very similar to infiltration or percolation basins. Whereas ponds attempt to hold water in place, percolation basins attempt to sink it into the ground. The soil underneath the water plays a key role in this - heavy rock or clay will often prevent infiltration, whereas looser or sandier soil will aid infiltration and raise the surrounding water table. </p><p><br></p><p><b>Basin</b> | <i>Moderate to Low Slope</i></p><p>Basins are simply large depressions dug out of the soil to capture and infiltrate water into the soil. They are often relatively shallow, especially compared to ponds, and this makes the sloped edges easier to stabilize with stones and/or vegetation. Plants not tolerant of wet feet may be mounded within the basin. Spillways are often connected to other basins. One of the most fundamental and effective patterns of water harvesting.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Boomerang Berm</b> | <i>Moderate to Low Slope</i></p><p>This method consists of creating a semi-circular depression surrounded by a mound. The opening faces uphill, the direction water will enter from, and the berm catches and concentrates water for the plants within. This method is a bit more modular and can be done one at a time, making it both versatile and approachable. The opening of the semi-circle should be roughly on contour. There is considerable variability regarding the size of this pattern based on what is being planted but it can be done even on a very small scale.</p><p><br></p><p><b>One Rock Dam</b> | <i>Moderate to Low Slope</i></p><p>Heavy stones are placed in a line on contour or in the path of flowing water. A simple and effective way of slowing down water and catching sediment or debris. The name of this method indicates that the 'dam' is only one rock high, however if enough sediment builds up another layer of stones can be placed on top. A fundamental and effective water management strategy. Logs can be used in a similar fashion. This method can also be used to create a baffle, which is essentially just a structure that slows and directs the movement of water. Instead of placing material evenly across the bed of a water channel, it can be placed off to one side. This will encourage the water to move towards the opposite side, creating a meandering effect that will help slow and sink water. <a href="https://www.harvestingrainwater.com/2022/02/shifting-dehydrating-degrading-ephemeral-water-channels-to-better-vegetated-rehydrating-agrading-channels-with-bill-zeedyk-directed-efforts-in-altar-valley-arizona/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Link]</a></p><p><br></p><p><b>Sheet Flow Spreader/Collecter</b> | <i>Moderate to Low Slope</i></p><p>Stones are shaped into a boomerang or semicircle to either collect the flow of water or spread it out. If water enters from 'inside' the boomerang, it will be spread out over a greater surface area and be pushed outwards, following the direction of the rock. If water enters from 'outside' the boomerang, it will be collected and concentrated towards the center, again following the direction of the stones. Another simple and effective strategy that is easy to experiment with.</p><p>.</p><p><b>Negarim</b> | <i>Low Slope</i></p><p>Berms shaped into adjacent diamonds, more appropriate for flatter land. The goal here is to catch all the rain that falls within each rectangle and contain it within the mounds along the perimeter. It is then further concentrated towards a particular corner using one of two methods. The land may be sloped towards this corner directly where perennials are planted, or the land may be flat and a deep hole is dug in the corner (to infiltrate water), next to which perennials are planted. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtHuIlfyJao" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Link]</a></p><p><br></p><p><b>Zai Pit</b> | <i>Low Slope</i></p><p>It doesn't get much simpler than digging a small hole and sticking a plant in it! But don't be fooled by the simplicity as this method can be extremely effective at concentrating rainwater. The holes can also be mulched with compost or organic matter to further aid growth. Typically organized into grids but a biointensive planting pattern may be more effective. Waffle gardens with square depressions are applications of the same concept. <a href="https://www.echocommunity.org/resources/3bbc0e7d-5730-4af1-901d-3b3c68c46c48" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Link]</a> <a href="https://www.ideassonline.org/public/pdf/ZAI-ENG.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Link]</a></p><p><br></p><p><b>Buried Ceramic</b> | <i>Low Slope</i></p><p>This method involves burying porous, ceramic containers or pipes in the ground and filling them with water that will slowly be released into the surrounding soil. Plants should be concentrated in the area surrounding the ceramic. The ceramic must be unglazed and porous so water can seep out. It is easiest to use deep ceramic planters, buried just until their tops are level with the soil. The dishes normally placed underneath the pot can instead be placed on top to prevent evaporation. This is an excellent way to stretch water collected from ponds or rain barrels.  </p><p><br></p><p>As you can see many of these methods are very similar - what's important is to understand the basic principles of slowing down or concentrating water so that it can better penetrate the soil. Even something as simple as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQkiv_U5AoU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">organizing stones into a line</a> can be an extremely effective water management method! The simplicity and elegance of primitive methods like this really display how brilliant our species can be at enriching landscapes. And of course these methods should be used in conjunction with dense planting, mulching and other patterns from our toolkit.</p><p>These landscaping methods are usually followed by planting trees, bushes or other perennials in the depressions, mounds or surrounding area depending on the context. And many can just as easily be used for planting vegetables! The depression of a swale could be planted with water-loving plants like taro or achira, and the mound may be better suited for plants that appreciate well-draining soil like good king henry or turkish rocket. A field of amaranth could be planted in zai pits with the surrounding mounds blanketed in an edible sedum like dolnamul. This is the beauty of it all - these methods create a higher density of biological niches that allow greater plant diversity and more creative polycultures, all while capturing water, improving soil and integrating our crops into the landscape.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Grass → Garden</h2><p>This is a rough and generalized process for converting areas overtaken by grasses and other vegetation into usable garden beds. This is not meant to be used for larger areas or fields - these usually need to be cleared and reseeded with the right equipment, or slowly transformed over a much longer period of time. </p><p><br></p><ul><li>1.

But if grasses or other native plants are not removed in any way, different methods are needed. Slowly transforming the space by transplanting larger perennials, especially trees and shrubs, is your best bet. I am also experimenting with crops like perilla and barley that can be direct seeded into compacted soil and succeed even with competition from grasses.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Methods</h2><p>The methods we use to grow, maintain, harvest and propagate crops can make all the difference in both the health of the ecosystem and how much work it requires to maintain. These are the basic principles I use in my garden.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Feed the soil. </b>Focus on crops that feed the soil. Plants like <i>Aralia cordata [udo]</i> and <i>Canna edulis [achira]</i> generate large amounts of top growth for mulching. Plants like <i>Raphanus sativus [radish]</i> and <i>Brassica rapa [turnip]</i> have fat roots that aerate the soil and feed beneficial bacteria when they decompose. Plants like <i>Elaeagnus multiflora [goumi]</i> and <i>Phaseolus coccineus [runner bean]</i> fix nitrogen in the soil and keep it productive. </p><p><b>Build structure.</b> Loose soil gets compacted and washed away with heavy rains. Healthy soil has structure that improves drainage, aeration and water retention, all while holding it together and preventing erosion. Roots build structure within the soil, while mulching in place builds structure above the soil. Tilling is avoided because it destroys soil structure and the fungal networks that depend on it. </p><p><b>Weed selectively.</b> Plants growing naturally in our beds can serve important functions. Many are edible themselves, help protect the soil, fix nitrogen or attract beneficial insects. Any plants that offer little function or excessively compete with our food crops are ripped up and mulched in place.</p><p><b>Disperse seeds naturally.</b> Naturally dispersed seeds land in slightly different niches and germinate intermittently. This improves the resiliency of the population in the face of unpredictable weather patterns and pressure from disease or insects. This also allows the soil to function as our seed bank, holding large quantities of seed until they are ready to grow. </p><p><b>Annuals alongside perennials. </b>Perennials offer stability and reliable production. These can be transplanted, a small amount of work for many years of food. Annuals have a different niche altogether and should be treated as such. They love taking advantage of disturbed soil and quickly filling in empty spaces between our perennials. Their seeds should be dispersed across the garden beds so they can spring into action when an opportunity presents itself.</p><p><b>Roots alongside roots. </b>Roots are an important source of energy, but many require deep soil disturbance to harvest. These should be primarily grown alongside other complementary root crops. This makes harvesting easier, ensures we don't damage nearby perennials, and limits the impact on soil structure. </p><p><b>Harvesting is selecting.</b> Harvesting the weakest plants allows the population to become stronger and better adapted to local conditions with every generation. Our first priority is not a big harvest, but plants with resilient and productive genetics.</p><p><b>Use local materials.</b> Most gardeners have access to natural materials like branches, leaves or grass clippings from adjacent land or the local community. A thick layer of leaves can be great for beds with primarily root crops or perennials. In beds where seed germination is a priority, I prefer grass clippings and small branches.</p><p><b>Harvest rain water. </b>Harvest as much rainwater as possible to reduce reliance on unsustainable sources of water. If plants can't be grown with locally available water, you might want to think twice about growing them at all. </p><p><b>Plant in islands. </b>Instead of clearing large areas all at once, create small 'islands' that can be planted densely and managed thoughtfully. Let native plants and weeds regenerate soil everywhere else until you are ready to expand. </p><p><br></p><p>The methods I use won't give you beds full of vegetables right away, and at first it may feel like nothing is working. This is totally normal! No amount of upfront work will change the fact that it takes time and persistence to learn how to care for plants. The first few years are always the hardest, but as time goes on it will get so much easier and so much more productive. If you trust the soil-building techniques and continue offering your service to the multitude of creatures that reside in your garden, then it is inevitable you will see improvements. I spend a lot of time on this stuff and still kill so many plants. Things are going wrong more often than not! Haha. Be patient.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Animal Interactions</h2><p>The right plant design will serve not only us humans but all of the creatures that live with us. Animals have different dietary requirements than we do and the way they interact with many plants also poses unique challenges. Taking these considerations into account is essential for creating a space we can comfortably share with our non-human brothers and sisters. In the plant list further down I do my best to indicate crops commonly fed to animals, although the information available for many plants is very limited.</p><p><br></p><h3>Sensitive Plants</h3><p>Half the battle of growing and designing for animals is that they will often eat anything you plant before it's had time to reach maturity! Protecting our plants from grazing or uprooting is the first priority, and there are a few different ways to approach this. Knowing what animals you are protecting against will make life much easier, but in reality it often takes many failed attempts to figure this out.</p><p><b>Fencing: </b>The easiest way to prevent sensitive plants from being eaten, dug up or damaged is to enclose them behind a fence. If the enclosed area is large enough for a deer to jump into, the fence should be roughly 6-7 feet high. If the enclosed area is narrow enough that deer can't or won't jump inside, the fence only need to be high enough to prevent any animals from reaching their head over the fence and eating the plants within. Exactly how high this is depends on how tall the the plants within the fence are. If animals or rodents digging underneath the fence is a concern, use a fence with a finer mesh and bury the bottom of it a few inches in the soil. See the equipment section at the bottom of the page for a simple tree fencing setup.</p><p><b>Height:</b> Plants that are high in the air can't get eaten! This mainly applies to trees and vines, both of which can also provide shelter or shade for animals underneath. Both still need to be protected when young, but once tall enough they will be safe from browsing. Keep in mind that even if a tree is tall enough to avoid or tolerate most browsing, it may still benefit from a fence to deter buck rubbing. This is when male deer rub their bucks against young trees to help speed up the velvet shedding process. Some form of protection may also still be required around the lower trunk of the tree to prevent rodents from chewing off the bark. This can be accomplished by loosely wrapping plastic or metal fencing around the trunk. Ideally the fencing will extend a few inches into the soil and still allow the bark to to receive both sunlight and airflow. </p><p><b>Cover:</b> Covering the soil with logs or stones can help prevent pigs, chickens or rodents from digging up plant roots. This is especially useful for tubers or root crops, but may also be useful for any trees, shrubs or plants with shallow root systems. It's as easy as covering the soil surrounding the plants with natural, heavy materials that won't get moved around easily. If you'd like to give the animals access to the plants once they've started producing, just remove some of the cover and let the animals find their way over.</p><p><b>Diversity: </b>A clean layer of mulch and easy-to-spot vegetables are practically an invitation for deer, rabbits or any other animals. Common wisdom dictates that planting herbs with pungent odors alongside your vegetables will help deter browsing. From personal experience I can tell you this doesn't really work in a microcosm. But having a densely planted bed with a variety of herbs, vegetables and weeds all growing on top of one another may help deter browsing to a certain degree.</p><p><br></p><h3>Resistant Plants</h3><p>Plants that are appetizing to wildlife can be protected using the methods above, but what about all the plants they aren't interested in eating? I can say with certainty it is possible to grow a garden filled with a diverse array of wildlife-resistant food plants, we just have to think outside the box. Having deer in the neighborhood is no longer an excuse!</p><p><b>Timing.</b> Some plants may only be eaten by wildlife during specific phases of growth or specific times of the year. <i>Hosta spp. [hosta]</i> plants are generally only eaten once they begin to leaf out. Because of this the shoots can still be harvested without any problems. <i>Hemerocallis spp. [daylily]</i> plants produce new flowers every day during certain portions of the year. With some prudence I can often harvest the flowers before the deer get them. Some other plants are not preferred browse during the growing season but will often get eaten in times of scarcity (typically during the winter). In my garden this includes some varieties of <i>Brassica oleracea [kale] </i>and<i> Allium cepa [onion]</i>. In these cases I often don't mind sharing as I can still harvest the plants for most of the year.</p><p><b>Taste.</b> Plants with pungent aromas or flavors are often left alone by wildlife. This includes some of my favorite herbs like <i>Agastache rugosa [Korean mint]</i>, <i>Pycnanthemum incanum [mountain mint]</i> and many others. It also includes many beloved vegetables! <i>Brassica rapa</i> <i>[turnip] </i>and other mustards are often resistant to browsing due to their off-putting flavor. <i>Perilla frutescens [perilla] </i>is also left alone by deer for this reason (but grow it with care as the plant is toxic to cows, goats and some other animals). Deer often eat potato leaves but <i>Tropaeolum tuberosum [mashua]</i> is avoided due to the hotness of the leaves.</p><p><b>Danger.</b> Many plants contain natural defenses to being eaten. The most obvious examples include those with spines, like some forms of <i>Opuntia humifusa [prickly pear]</i>, or those with stinging hairs, like <i>Urtica dioica [stinging nettle]</i>. It also includes plants which contain high levels of irritating calcium oxalate like <i>Colocasia esculenta [taro]</i>. We can prepare these plants to make them safe to eat but animals typically avoid them. And don't forget the many woody, thorny plants like <i>Aralia elata [angelica tree]</i> and <i>Rubus idaeus [raspberry]</i>.</p><p><br></p><p>These considerations may help prevent some animals or wildlife from eating your crops, but at the end of the day we can only do so much. Deer will often eat plants you would never expect them to. Squirrels can climb your trees and birds can fly just about anywhere, so without covering your entire garden in a net there is no way to protect everything. Designing an ecosystem where animal life is balanced with plant life is the ideal, but that is the work of many lifetimes. So I just try to be grateful that those who visit my garden are able to appreciate it. We have taken so much from them already, it is the least I can do.</p><p>There are also many cases where animals interacting with your plants or landscape is ultimately beneficial. Bunnies may eat the food in my garden, but they also usually leave behind fresh fertilizer that improves the soil. A local chipmunk digs holes in my beds, but these can just be thought of as small water-infiltration basins!</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>What would it mean for us to come to terms with the knowledge that civilization, our whole mode of development and culture, has been premised and built upon extermination—on a history experienced as "terror without end" (to borrow a phrase from Adorno)? To dwell on such a thought would be to throw into almost unbearable relief the distance between our narratives of inherent human dignity and grace and moral superiority, on the one hand, and the most elemental facts of our actual social existence, on the other. </i></p><p><i>We congratulate ourselves for our social progress—for democratic governance and state-protected civil and human rights (however notional or incompletely defended)—yet continue to enslave and kill millions of sensitive creatures who in many biological, hence emotional and cognitive particulars resemble us.

And to cease through such forfeiture man is to become demon."

Historically, humans have subsisted on a wide variety of plants but typically rely on a much smaller number of species for the bulk of their calories. What I'm searching for is a small selection of plant heavyweights from around the world that can serve as the foundation of a food garden and be multiplied to produce at any scale, whether that's just a small backyard or a large food forest that feeds a community.</p><p>This is based on a few different criteria: how easy they are to grow and use; how productive they are; their culinary, nutritional and medicinal qualities; and their ability to grow in tough environments, regenerate soil or contribute to the local ecosystem.</p><h3><br></h3><table tableid="d02a9a84" columns="6" style="--columns: 6; --rows: 7;" rows="7" class=""><tr><td class=""><b style="font-size: 16px;">Vegetables</b></td><td class=""><b style="font-size: 16px;">Roots</b></td><td class=""><b style="font-size: 16px;">Roots</b></td><td class=""><b style="font-size: 16px;">Seeds</b></td><td class=""><b style="font-size: 16px;">Woody</b></td><td class=""><b>Support</b></td></tr><tr><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Aralia Cordata 'Udo' (Perennial)</span></td><td class="">Allium Ampeloprasum 'Leek' (Perennial)*</td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Helianthus Tuberosus 'Sunchoke' (Perennial)*</span></td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Amaranthus Caudatus 'Amaranth' (Annual)*</span></td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Corylus Americana 'American Hazelnut' (Perennial)*</span></td><td class="">Trifolium Repens 'White Clover' (Perennial)</td></tr><tr><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Chenopodium Bonus-Henricus 'Good King Henry' (Perennial)</span></td><td class="">Allium Fistulosum 'Bunching Onion' (Perennial)</td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Solanum Tuberosum 'Potato' (Perennial)*</span></td><td class="">Helianthus Annuus 'Sunflower' (Annual)</td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Prunus Americana 'Plum' (Perennial)</span></td><td class="">Paulownia Tomentosa 'Empress Tree' (Perennial)</td></tr><tr><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Dystaenia Takesimana 'Seombadi' (Perennial)</span></td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Allium Hookeri 'Hooker's Onion' (Perennial)</span></td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Dioscorea Batatas 'Chinese Yam' (Perennial)</span></td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Phaseolus Coccineus 'Runner Bean' (Annual)</span></td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Elaeagnus Multiflora 'Goumi' (Perennial)</span></td><td class="">Symphytum Uplandicum 'Comfrey' (Perennial)</td></tr><tr><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Bunias Orientalis 'Turkish Rocket' (Perennial)</span></td><td class="">Scorzonera Hispanica 'Spanish Salsify' (Perennial)</td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Platycodon Grandiflorus 'Doraji' (Perennial)</span></td><td class="">Hordeum Vulgare 'Barley' (Annual)</td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Actinidia Arguta 'Hardy Kiwi' (Perennial)</span></td><td class="">Borago Officinalis 'Borage' (Annual)</td></tr><tr><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Opuntia Humifosa 'Prickly Pear' (Perennial)</span></td><td class="">Brassica Rapa Rapa 'Turnip' (Biennial)</td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Canna Edulis 'Achira' (Annual)*</span></td><td class=""><br></td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Ficus Carica 'Fig' (Perennial)*</span></td><td class="">Fagopyrum Esculentum 'Buckwheat' (Annual)</td></tr><tr><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Cucurbita Maxima 'Squash' (Annual)*</span></td><td class="">Daucus Carota Sativa 'Carrot' (Biennial)</td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Colocasia Esculenta 'Taro' (Annual)*</span></td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;"> </span></td><td class=""><span style="font-size: 16px;">Morus Nigra 'Mulberry' (Perennial)*</span></td><td class=""><br></td></tr></table><p><sup>*High priority plants.</sup></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Polycultures</h2><p>The following are experimental group plantings I am testing. I find polycultures most useful for root crops as they often require regular or deep soil disturbance and replanting, whereas many other vegetables and herbs can often grow alongside each other without much trouble.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Large Seeds: Amaranth + Bean + Dolnamul [+ Sunflower] </b></p><p><i>Moderate Soil / Part Shade To Sun </i></p><p>A classic formula with some new faces. The three sisters uses squash as a ground cover. I would rather grow the squash elsewhere and instead hold fertility in the soil with perennial ground covers. Transplant the amaranth into the sedum and direct seed the beans right next to it. Sunflowers can be transplanted just like the amaranth. Harvest dolnamul and beans as needed. Harvest amaranth and sunflower at the end of the growing season.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Large Roots: Achira + Taro + Water Celery [+ Wapato]</b></p><p><i>Moist &amp; Rich Soil / Part Shade To Sun </i></p><p>This is a prime time polyculture with three productive root crops. I use it in the best spot in the garden that stays moist year round and gets lots of sun. If the soil is wet enough wapato can be incorporated as well. Produces a lot of mulch that can be applied back to the same spot once harvested. Harvest water celery as needed during the growing season. Harvest achira, taro, and wapato when they've died back.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Small Roots: Potato + Leek [+ Bunching Onion]</b></p><p><i>Moderate &amp; Loose Soil / Part Shade To Sun </i></p><p>Designed for low-till cultivation in which the potatoes wait in the ground until the oca has died back at the end of the growing season. Then the entire bed is harvested and reset for the following year. Save a seed potato/oca from each plant and replant immediately after harvesting to remain dormant in the soil until spring. Harvest and divide leeks as needed.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Competitive Roots: Sunchoke + Chinese Yam [+ Perilla]</b></p><p><i>Moderate &amp; Loose Soil / Sun </i></p><p>I like growing these together because they are both very competitive and can be difficult to remove once established. I plant them in a spot that is easy to manage where neither can escape. Sunchoke is the heavy-yielding star of the show and the trellis for the chinese yam. The yam should be planted in buried and perforated drainage pipes or grow bags in front of the sunchoke (so it doesn't get shaded out). This allows us to harvest the sunchoke without disturbing the yam, and makes harvesting the yam every 2nd or 3rd year much easier. Perilla will appreciate the regular soil disturbance and fill in any gaps. Harvest yam and perilla leaves as needed. Harvest roots of sunchoke and yam at the end of the growing season.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Competetive Climbers: Chinese Buglweed + Achocha [+ Nasturtium]</b></p><p><i>Moderate Soil / Part Shade To Sun </i></p><p>Chinese bugleweed forms dense patches of tall stems that make an excellent trellis! Achocha is a vigorous climber and will clamber around, moving from one stem to the next with it's long tendrils. Toss some ripe achocha fruits back on the soil at the end of the growing season and the seeds will germinate on their own the following spring. </p><p><br></p><p><b>Competetive Fruit: Elderberry + Gua Lou + Raspberry + Wild Strawberry</b></p><p><i>Moderate Soil / Shade To Sun </i></p><p>Some of the easiest and most vigorous fruits to grow in the backyard. Elderberry grows tall and strong, spreading by suckers. It serves as the trellis for gua lou which grows quickly and clambers around. Raspberry fills in the space around it and strawberry covers ground quickly to hold in moisture. What is so wonderful about this selection is that all these plants are adapted to growing in both sun and shade. Harvest fruits of all four as they ripen.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Annual Regeneratives: Buckwheat + Borage + Barley + Clover [+ Cow Pea]  </b></p><p><i>Poor Or Compacted Soil / Part Shade To Sun </i></p><p>This mix is designed for rapid soil regeneration with minimal effort. It can be applied to new or old beds, and can be used alone or dispersed to grow alongside previously established plantings. Buckwheat and borage are soil regeneration superstars that will feed pollinators and self-sow year after year. Barley grows in the toughest of conditions and clover covers ground while fixing nitrogen. Peas can be incorporated as an additional nitrogen fixer that will climb on the others. Harvest buckwheat leaves and borage leaves/flowers as needed. Harvest buckwheat and barley seeds at the end of the growing season. </p><p><br></p><p><b>Perennial Regeneratives: Empress Tree + Alpine Dock + Comfrey [+ Japanese Mugwort] </b></p><p><i>Poor Or Compacted Soil / Shade To Sun </i></p><p>These are some of my favorite soil builders. Empress tree makes huge, nitrogen-rich leaves and can be cut back at the end of each growing season to prevent it from becoming a tree (it will regrow from roots and makes bigger leaves this way). Alpine dock and comfrey both have extensive root systems and strong, dense foliage. Japanese mugwort may be a controversial choice, but it grows very quickly, can be cut back regularly, and if managed properly is an excellent source of mulch.</p><p><br></p><p>These polycultures are not self-sustaining and should be regularly fed/mulched. Beans, peas or clover can be incorporated for nitrogen. Plants that draw pollinators may also be helpful to control pests. Think of these polycultures as building blocks that interact with and depend on the diversity of the rest of the garden. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Man, do not pride yourself on your superiority to the animals, for they are without sin, while you, with all your greatness, you defile the earth wherever you appear and leave an ignoble trail behind you -- and that is true, alas, for almost every one of us!</i></p><p><i>-Fyodor Dostoyevsky</i></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Guide</h2><p><b>Annual/Perennial: </b>Designations for Z7a, may differ in other climates. Since I only grow plants in one location I usually cannot indicate how hardy they are, only if they survive winters where I am. Hardiness zones also do not take into account many important factors, notably how long low temperatures occur for and how wet the soil is over winter. West coast Z7 and east coast Z7 are two very different climates. For this reason many plants that are supposedly hardy to Z7 may not survive the wet and cold winters of Maryland. Microclimates can also be the reason one plant survives winter while another in the same neighborhood does not.</p><p>I typically try to use the most common English name for the plant, although the Latin name is always the most accurate. I also sometimes include the name of the plant in the most relevant language to help with personal research. </p><p><b>Edible:</b> Useful edible parts. Not comprehensive, not a reference, only a starting point. Often there will be more edible portions than indicated, but I may not mention them for any number of reasons. Do not eat anything you are not 100% familiar with. Always be certain of your identification and the parts edible. Consult multiple sources, see resources at the end of page. </p><p>I do not always indicate whether a plant can be eaten raw or must be cooked. Some plants cannot be eaten raw but can be cooked or prepared in some other way, such as drying or fermenting. Processes like fermenting will sometimes render a food safe to eat in the same way that cooking would. But it is not always this simple. Many plants must be prepared in a specific way in order to make them safe to eat. <i>Petasites Japonicus</i>, for example, should always be both blanched and peeled prior to eating. Or consider <i>Rheum Acuminatum</i>, a little-known species of rhubarb. It is usually dried and pickled before being eaten. Does this mean it cannot just be cooked like other species of rhubarb? It may be totally harmless, or maybe the fermenting accomplishes something that cooking does not, something we are not aware of. Tradition is wise, but it rarely explains itself. And even if it was harmful, the effects are unlikely to be obvious. Some plants can quietly build up toxins in your body for decades before manifesting themselves as symptoms of an illness. So just because a plant can be eaten without any noticeable adverse effects does not mean that it is safe to eat regularly over a longer period of time. This is why it is important to understand the history of how foods are prepared and eaten. After that, if you want to experiment then the risk is yours to take. But as far as this reference goes, I try to stay conservative. </p><p><u>Root:</u> Plants that store energy in roots or tubers usually draw on this energy to produce flowering shoots. Perennial roots are therefore usually harvested after the plant has flowered and been given ample time to store more energy in the roots. This is often at the end of the growing season. Annual or biennial roots are harvested before flowering as in this case it signifies the end of the plant's life. To maximize harvests we can dig up the root after it's done most of its growing but before it has a chance to start producing a flowering shoot. After flowering occurs the root will be tough and inedible. However, whether annual or perennial the best practices for harvesting will depend on the specific plant and growing conditions.</p><p><u>Shoot:</u> Shoot refers only to the young growth of the plant when it first emerges from the ground; in other words, the entire aerial portion of the young plant, often in spring. This is <i>not</i> the same as terminal or tender new growth (see below). How large the young plant is when harvested depends on the specific plant. Just because a shoot is edible does not mean that any part of the mature plants is edible. If a plant contains harmful or toxic substances, these may be in low enough quantities when the plant is young but not when it matures. If the mature leaves of a plant are edible then usually so is the shoot, but depending on the plant I may not write this if it is not normally eaten that way (as in the case with many herbs). Shoots are valued for their sweet flavor and tender texture, especially when the mature plant may be bitter or tough. They are therefore often the preferred harvest of a plant.</p><p><u>Stem, Leaf &amp; Petiole:</u> If the leaf is edible then usually so is the terminal or tender new growth, harvested with some of the new stem. In fact, when the leaves are small, young or tightly bunched this can often be the best time to harvest. I only indicate separately that the stem is edible when it constitutes a meaningful portion of the edible harvest or when it can be eaten even when relatively mature. For example, amaranth or nettle are often eaten with some of the tender stem, but I only write the leaf is edible because the stem is relatively insignificant to the harvest. If the leaf is edible then so is the petiole unless a distinction has been made in the individual listing. Some references refer to petioles as leaf stalk but I avoid this to prevent confusion. </p><p><u>Inflorescence + Flower:</u> Flowering shoots are a separate identification and are indicated as inflorescence. These are eaten when still young, clustered, and tender. If the inflorescence is edible then often so are the flower buds and flowers, although this may not always be practical or palatable. There are roughly three stages for harvest: entire young inflorescence while still tender, sometimes with some of the tender stem attached; the individual, unopened flower buds picked off once the flowering stem becomes tougher; the blooming flowers when fully or partially open. Some plants are only eaten during one stage, while some can be eaten during all three. Once a plant begins to form a flowering shoot, the leaves usually become more bitter and tough as energy is being drawn away to support the flowers. Plants with leaves that do not become bitter during flowering are often valued for this trait. </p><p><u>Seed:</u> I will occasionally indicate the seed is edible if it is useful in some way. Just because a flower is edible does not mean the seed is, and vice versa.</p><p>Some of the plants are marked as calorie crops. This is to indicate they are efficient producers of calories given one growing season and a limited amount of space. This is almost entirely root and seed crops. It does not include many other useful and potential staple crops that take longer to grow or are not as efficient.</p><p>The best way to know how to eat a plant is to do research, grow it and become familiar with it. Even with references, the actual details of how it's harvested and eaten can vary between plants. And keep in mind that many online references are just summarizing (often poorly or incorrectly) physical reference books that provide more detail. If a plant is uncommon, then especially thorough research is required. Typically we are looking to answer a few basic questions. Is there an extensive history of humans eating this part of the plant? If so, how is it prepared and in what quantity is it eaten? Are there any indications that this plant may contain harmful or toxic substances? The more information you have, the better.<i>  </i></p><blockquote><i>Always remember the golden rule: if it's not regularly eaten, don't eat it regularly. </i></blockquote><p>Just because one species in a genus is edible does not mean that other species are. And just because one part of the plant is edible does not mean that others parts are. These kinds of assumptions will put you in the hospital or in the ground. There are even cases (as with some members of the <i>Calystegia </i>genus) where one variety of a species is edible but another variety within the very same species is not. Therefore we must be thoughtful about what exactly we are eating and recognize that academic taxonomy has its limits. Even if an online resource says something is edible (including this one), you must do your own research!</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Useful methods of propagation. Usually seed, stem cutting, or rhizome/tuber/root division. Seeds that prefer cold stratification or sunlight to germinate are often noted as such. I sometimes try to get bare roots or potted plants if a seed is difficult to germinate.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Rough guidelines for minimum sun requirements: Sun (≈90-100%) → Part Shade (≈60-90%) → Shade (≈30-60%) → Deep shade (≈0-30%). Estimating sun is difficult, but I do my best to give rough guidelines. Most of the time, if a plant prefers shade, it will also prefer rich and moist soil. And keep in mind that just because a plants prefers sun doesn't mean it can handle the heat summer usually brings. This is often true for plants that grow naturally in cooler climates, such as in high altitudes or in coastal areas. Some plants have markers that indicate they grow easily or self-sow, these are great plants to start with. </p><p><b>Wildlife:</b> Impact of wildlife and insects on plant. We have lots of deer as well as chipmunks, rabbits and birds that live nearby. I try to grow enough food for everyone, but I can't let them eat everything! I have some fenced areas for sensitive plants I don't want being bothered. I try to be as hands-off as possible and rarely remove insects from plants or interfere with their growth. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Everything else. Observations about growth habits, useful varieties, hardiness, harvesting, interactions with other plants and more. Plants with photos were grown in Maryland, roughly zone 7a. You may notice some of the plants in my photos don't look perfectly healthy - this is okay. If it is a perennial, as long as it has a healthy root system it will grow just fine after being planted and given a few seasons to adjust. </p><p><u>Soil &amp; Climate:</u> The conditions are fairly wet year round, although in the summer there are stretches where the soil dries out. Soil is good overall, some spots with heavy clay and some very sandy. Normally the only time I water plants is while they are getting established. Most non-perennial plants survive (or die) exclusively on rain water, unless they are lucky enough to be near a perennial I'm watering.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Herbs</h2><p><br></p><h3>Agastache Rugosa 'Korean Mint' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.

They can still come back to life come spring but you'll have better luck with the plant if it is in a sheltered spot that still gets plenty of sun. There is also a creeping variety. Now in the same genus as all the sages but definitely an outlier from them. </p><p>Common garden sage, <b>S. officinalis</b>, is a standard and suitably cold hardy in my region.

Germination is so good that this plant can easily become weedy. Plants will overwinter easily, usually with all their leaves still green, and go on to produce dense mounds of foliage. They are vigorous growers that cover the surrounding soil well and suppress germinating seeds or weeds. These qualities may be useful in some areas but an annoyance in others. The plant in flower is also something to behold, growing over five feet high with dozens of delicate stems and even more delicate flowers. I would probably rather have this in an area I am rehabilitating or a larger/wilder bed just because of the way it grows and flowers.

Its leaves are said to resemble those of Seseli libanotis.</blockquote><p>It is sometimes eaten by locals, both the cooked root and leaves, but to what extent is unclear. <i>Useful Plants Of Japan, Described And Illustrated</i> writes that this species is actually "very poisonous". This is mentioned under the entry for ashitaba, warning foragers not to mistake the two. This seems to be a reputable source and is quite clear on the matter. <i>Eating Wild Japan </i>writes that it is not poisonous but not typically eaten. A Japanese reference book I have also says it is not eaten. Another says only the roots are of any value.</p><p>Of course, there is no obvious resolution. All or some of the plant may have a compound that makes it unsafe for regular consumption. Certain methods of preparation may make it safer for eating (like fuki or ferns). It is also possible that some forms are safer than others, as there are at least a few different varieties. Ultimately, I would avoid it unless you are already very familiar with it.

Of these I tend to focus on kale because this particular variety of kale is known to have some perennial forms. Most kale will set seed after their first winter, but some forms will either set seed after 2-3 years of growth or never/rarely set seed at all. Those that don't set seed are usually propagated by stem cutting. Stem cuttings can be placed in moist soil to root and clone the original plant. Out of many plants grown only one has proven to be hardy enough and lived more than 2 years. But the wonderful thing about this plant is that once you find a good form like this, it's only a matter of taking some cuttings and planting it all around the garden. </p><p>I am particularly interested in the forms that can live for a few years before setting seed. This not only ensures genetic diversity but also opens up the possibility of harvesting the inflorescence and perhaps breeding some form of a short-lived perennial kale/broccoli vegetable. I also wonder about the potential for a polycarpic perennial kale (flowering more than once). To the best of my knowledge this does not yet exist and those that will live longer when the flowerheads are cut off do not count. So I do see a lot of potential.</p><p>Some plants are cold hardy but many are not. Like others in this genus it is very susceptible to insects.

The main harvest from cardoon is the thick petioles and midribs (or leaf stalk).</p><p>Theoretically, cardoon should be an obvious selection for any garden where it will grow as a perennial. The plant does not need great soil and can grow in sun or part shade. It effectively blocks out nearby competition with its large leaves and creates a significant amount of biomass for mulching. Mature plants produce a sizeable harvest as well. The only catch is that the stalks can be quite unpalatable straight off the plant. This is why they are usually blanched by wrapping some sort of paper or cloth around the leaves. And even then they should be peeled, chopped and thoroughly boiled. So a wonderful vegetable to grow but may be a hassle to prepare. </p><p>Some varieties of cardoon have spines, but I would avoid these and instead opt for those without. The flowers are stunning and appreciated by pollinators. I grew out a few plants of the Gobbo di Nizza variety but none survived winter. I will continue trialing other varieties, but it may be the case that all records of it surviving Z7 winters are for the west coast.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/cp6msvsbd32n" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. cardunculus.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Dystaenia Takesimana 'Seombadi' '섬바디' | Perennial 🖤</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.

On top of that it is also a renowned medicinal and adaptogen! Most references actually only mention the medicinal qualities and skip over the fact that the leaves can be cooked and eaten as a vegetable as well. Leaves taste very sweet. The plant prefers shade and dies back to its roots every year, making it easy to incorporate into the understory and easy to manage once established. </p><p>Older specimens still have the potential to smother shrubs so this should be taken into account. I have one planted right below an old ornamental bush I don't care about and it seems very happy. Vines can be a difficult element to incorporate into food forests but this one is fairly straightforward. Viable seed is only produced when a male and female plant are present. The appearance is somewhat similar to Virginia creeper but jiaogulan has visible leaf petioles and leaf hears, as well as a different leaflet arrangement. </p><p>Most references indicate this plant is only hardy to about Z7. I can confirm it overwinters in my climate without any special protection. An eBay seller who is supposedly from Z4 claims they have a hardy cultivar that overwinters in their climate.

Cultivated as a vegetable in China. The flowers are some of the best out there being sweet and delicious, even when raw. </p><p>The flowers can be eaten as buds or fully opened. They are cooked, dried, pickled or sometimes eaten raw. The shoots are also eaten as a vegetable, but the leaves quickly get tough if left to grow. The roots are less commonly eaten. Most online resources indicate any species is fine to eat, whether its the flowers, shoots or roots. But not every species has a recorded history of being eaten, and those that do often do not include all three parts of the plant.</p><p>It seems the roots in particular are seldom or never eaten depending on the species.<i> Edible Wild Plants Of Vietnam</i> indicates at least one species used for edible flowers has mildly toxic roots. Granted this book isn't the most reliable but it's worth noting. <i>The Encyclopedia Of Edible Plants Of North America </i>mentions the roots of some species are eaten<i> </i>but <i>Food Plants Of</i> <i>China</i> makes no mention of it for any of the species it lists. Both<i> Plants For Human Consumption</i> and <i>Cornucopia </i>only list some of the species as having an edible root. Many are listed as being eaten only for the shoots and flowers. Let us remember one of our basic principles - just because one species in a genus is edible in a certain way does not mean others are! </p><p>My recommendation is to stick to the species with a history of being eaten and not to bother with the roots. Along with this yellow flowering species eaten in Japan, this includes <b>H. fulva </b>(common orange ditch lily)<b> </b>and <b>H. lilioasphodelus/H. flava </b>(shorter plant with sweet-scented, yellow flowers). There are many others.</p><p>Daylilies will grow in most soils and do fine in fairly deep shade. The common orange ditch lily is an aggressive spreader so put it in a spot that's easy to manage. Other species grow slower and are easily managed. Overall, they are an excellent perennial vegetable very well suited for food forest projects.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/q64e7778a2vs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hemerocallis spp.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Hosta Montana 'Hosta' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, leaf, petiole.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, preferred.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established. ✅</p><p><b>Notes: </b>The situation for hostas is similar to that of daylilies - there is an extensive history of some species being eaten, and the rest are often assumed to be just as safe. I would suggest sticking with the well-documented species or doing your own research for the specific species you are interested in. This species is a standard in Japan and the normal recommendation. </p><p>It is primarily the shoots, young leaves and petioles that are eaten. Most English sources do not mention the petioles but they appear in Japanese reference books more frequently. They are a good way to extend the harvest of the plant once the leaves become too big and tough. The flowers are sometimes a very minor crop as well, however <i>Food Plants Of China </i>indicates the flowers of <b>H. plantaginea</b> require cooking to detoxify them. Therefore do not assume they are safe raw for any species without evidence to the contrary. I have seen an absurd amount of sources claiming the flowers of all species are edible raw but I have never seen any valid reference that corroborates this. Completely irresponsible.</p><p>The fact that hostas can tolerate full sun or deep shade makes them very fun to have in the garden. I can have other plants growing right next to them and they don't mind the shade it creates at all. They can act as a sort of groundcover in that way and still provide a high quality vegetable.</p><p>Will tolerate most conditions as long as the soil is not overly dry. Useful for deep shade where edible options are limited. Although the deer love it, there shouldn't be a problem harvesting the shoots as they typically only eat it later on in the growth cycle. That being said, if a small plant is continually eaten to the ground then it may simply die. Another excellent perennial vegetable for food forests. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/qtrlaudv6in9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hosta spp.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Houttuynia Cordata 'Fish Mint' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Rhizome,<b> </b>shoot, leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">SPREADS AGGRESSIVELY</b></p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: <u>Deer resistant.</u></p><p><b>Status:</b> Established. ✅</p><p><b>Notes: </b>First, a word of warning: do not plant this in the ground. This plant spreads so aggressively and is so impossible to remove that it's almost always better to keep it contained in a pot where it has no chance of escaping. It thrives in wet and shady locations but will grow anywhere, even in sun and average soil. Try to pull it up and the petioles are so fragile that they break first, leaving the rhizome in the ground. I've been pulling these up for years! In one location I've planted Japanese butterbur, an equally aggressive plant, to hopefully out compete/shade it out.</p><p>In my experience this plant is not going to be a regular part of your diet. I only have the variegated version but the taste is fairly off-putting. To the best of my knowledge the variegated variety is edible in the same way although I can't be certain. I cannot imagine anyone eating this as a vegetable in any meaningful quantity. There is also a chance I am mildly allergic to it. Your best best would be to use the rhizomes or spring shoots as a garnish. Personally I wouldn't bother with it given the choice.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/v66amu168946" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">H. cordata.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Ipomoea Aquatica 'Water Spinach' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.

No doubt an amazing option in tropical climates where it is perennial (if prevented from escaping), but in annual climates it is more of a hassle. Not only does it need wet soil, it also only really gets going in warm weather. The seed pods barely had enough time to ripen in my climate, so the prospect of it self seeding seems unlikely. If harvesting seed pods let them dry before cracking them open carefully to reveal 2-4 large seeds. The plant spreads horizontally on the ground, making it potentially very useful in polycultures.</p><p>It is still a unique vegetable with interesting potential but not my favorite.

In conditions with low competition and tough soil, it makes sense that the plant would spend more time working on a deep root to draw up nutrients and water. It doesn't need to worry about being shaded out.

Leaves are usually harvested in early spring when still tender, and at this point they can be eaten raw. Older leaves or those harvested later in the season should be cooked. One of my favorite plants as it is not picky and is a stunning specimen when mature. I like to have these all around the garden and plant as many as I can.</p><p>Seed grown plants seem to display a range of characteristics, so this vegetable offers a good opportunity for further selection and breeding.

Considered an escaped weed in many areas but a very old Korean vegetable that has been relied on for centuries. This plant is also the perfect example of one of the paradoxes most gardeners confront - vegetables that are too easy to grow are seen as weeds, and vegetables that are more difficult to grow just make life harder for us! Why not embrace the weedy vegetables? Why make life harder than it is? If you plant these out of the way and make sure their seeds don't get spread around it's no problem at all. </p><p>It grows enthusiastically and can tolerate shade and dry soil fairly well (it does need water but don't believe online sources that say it needs consistently moist soil). Many forms are quite bushy and can get over 5 feet high with tons of fragrant leaves! Red varieties are used mare as a garnish while green varieties are used more as a vegetable or for kimchi. Young and tender flowering shoots are edible whole, while flowers/buds can be picked off older shoots. <b>P. frutescens var. crispa </b>is the Japanese variety often called shiso, and <b>P. frutescens var. frutescens </b>is the korean variety<b> </b>often called perilla, although the names are sometimes used interchangeably. </p><p>The 38N Kkaennip variety has done exceptionally well for me after just tossing the seeds around the beds. This variety is wonderful and a standard. A bit tougher than other varieties but it makes up for that in how well it grows. This variety also sometimes 'catches' the flowers that fall off on the leaves below - these can be collected and used as a garnish. Green Ao is a nice Japanese variety, a bit softer and better for eating raw, but not nearly as vigorous. This one flowers and dies earlier too.</p><p>Many varieties can get quite big and shade out nearby plants, so this is another reason to keep it out of the way. It is easy to imagine filling large areas with this plant in just a season or two. Big specimens will also produce a surprisingly thick and woody stem. This sort of carbon generation combined with its vigorous growth and ability to shade out weeds makes me think it could have a place in soil regeneration. As long as it can be controlled and easily removed for succession.

Unlike the runner bean which always climbs, there are both bushy varieties and climbing varieties. If eating the raw pods of any species in this genus be sure to pick them when quite young.

Naturally more of a woodland plant so it is adapted to some shade, but they already grow slowly enough as it is so the more sun they can get the better. The tubers form along long rhizomes, and the plant does best with something to climb on, although it can be allowed to sprawl. Take care when weeding so as not to yank any plants that the vine has attached itself to. </p><p>Perennial, vining, cold hardy root crops are rare so this serves an interesting niche in that regard. It also fixes nitrogen but since the root is the part harvested I am unsure if it would benefit the soil as much as other nitrogen fixers.</p><p>Wild varieties can be very small compared to improved varieties coming out of some breeding programs, so make sure to order an improved variety.

I like to think of them as being more efficient producers of food because of this - many more popular vegetables need lots of nutrients, but turnips can create the same amount of food with a lot less. So you get more mileage from your soil with them, at least that's my thought process. This is probably one of the reasons they used to be a lot more common, before fertilizer was so readily available. </p><p>Of all the species in the Brassica genus, I think turnips show the most potential. They can be eaten for their leaves or flowering shoots, just like the others. In fact, they are often just as good as the others in this regard. But they also have a root! So not only do they do what the others do, they also provide a great source of energy in the form of a taproot on top of that. This is great for two reasons. One, it is an additional, calorie-dense harvest. Two, it is a wonderful way to feed the soil. So even if you don't care about the root, you can harvest the leaves and let the root die, aerating and feeding the soil! </p><p>I think there is potential to use turnips as the foundation for breeding a super-mustard. In my imagination this is a mustard that makes a fat taproot, produces an abundance of mild leaves and tender flowering shoots, and only sets seed after overwintering. Now that would be nice, right? Unfortunately they don't seem to overwinter reliably in my climate. I will continue my search for the right hardy and productive variety.</p><p>Used to pelt ancient roman governors, not just a nutritious food but also a revolutionary weapon!

Containers of soil will heat up faster so the rhizomes sprout sooner. As long as the last frost has passed, transplanting them this way will give you a huge headstart over rhizomes planted directly into beds. </p><p>This is one of my favorite plants and the single-most underutilized crop I have yet to come across. First off, this plant is very easy to grow. Despite the tropical appearance it will produce even in temperate climates with relatively short growing seasons. It needs mostly sun but is not picky about soil and does just fine surviving off rainwater in my garden, with periods where the soil dries out. Many references indicate it needs consistently moist soil - this will improve yields but it is absolutely not essential. These plants are resilient.</p><p>Second, not only is it gorgeous but it makes an incredible amount of high quality biomass. The leaves are thick and the stems are chunky. This is an amazing mulch plant and I would grow it just for this purpose even if it also did not produce an edible root! Excellent for soil regeneration.</p><p>Finally, this plant is productive. It requires the entire growing season, but expect yields of at least 5 or 6 pounds per plant in non-optimal conditions. With the right soil, water and sun you will get even more out of it. That is insanely productive and this is one of the highest calorie-producing roots for temperate climates. This plant may be a perennial in Z8 and above but does not survive winters here. Young root can be harvested mid-season by slicing it with a shovel and leaving the rest in the ground. Does not store particularly well so it may be best to start eating it while it's still growing. Heavy winds may bend or rip some leaves but this is never much of a problem. </p><p>One of the main drawbacks of this plant is that flowers rarely form, and even then they rarely produce seed. There are also very few clones available. And on top of that there are multiple viruses that are extremely common, so much so that nurseries often ship infected plants. These then easily spread the virus to other nearby plants. The only way to get around this would be to start a new plant from seed, but these rarely produce any. This is, in my eyes, the main issue with this plant. But viruses don't stop people from growing potatoes!</p><p>Can be eaten raw but usually cooked. The easiest way to prepare the roots is to bake with the skin attached. Bake thoroughly until the the inside is completely soft. Then peal off the skin before eating. It is somewhat neutral in flavor but slightly sweet. I have no doubt it could be made into a perfectly appetizing dish. </p><p><b>C. indica</b> can be grown and used the same way but there is no reason to do this because the yields are much lower. </p><p>🦕<i> This plant is featured in a polyculture.</i></p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/q2oloee4saj8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. edulis.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Chaerophyllum Bulbosum 'Root Chervil' | Biennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.

One could spend an entire lifetime learning how to grow this sacred plant, and many still do. Unfortunately here in the states most varieties are purely ornamental and it's difficult to find anything besides the most common edible varieties. And these edible varieties are often eaten in different ways, so it's important to understand how each specific variety is prepared. Some are grown for the main corm, some for the dormant cormells, some for the petioles or young leaves.

Most do not reliably overwinter below Z8. The more water they have the better, but they are fine with normal garden conditions as well. Many are under the impression taro can only be grown in tropical climates, but this isn't true. It will still produce in temperate climates if you have the right variety!</p><p>I like to plant these the same way I do achira: in spring set them outside in a container of soil and once they sprout transplant them into beds. Containers of soil will heat up faster so the corms sprout sooner. As long as the last frost has passed, transplanting them this way will give you a huge headstart over corms planted directly into beds. Corms are formed continuously as the plants grows, so even if it doesn't grow very long you will still get something out of it. If not for eating at least to divide and replant next season. </p><p><b>C. gigantea</b> is a little-known relative of taro called Bac Ha. It grows much larger than taro, older specimens growing over 6 feet high! The leaves are also huge and magnificent, hence the common name giant taro. </p><p>Unfortunately only the leaf petioles are eaten, so it provides far less food than taro does. Still, the petioles are a unique and delicious vegetable, something like spongy celery, often used in soups. Many references indicate they need to be peeled, but I personally do not peel the young and tender petioles. Older petioles should certainly be peeled though. They should also be cooked as far as I'm aware, although it may be possible they can be eaten raw. I am unsure of how much calcium oxalate this species has. I have nibbled on the raw petioles before.</p><p>There are also ornamental clones of this species such as 'Thailand Giant' or similar ones sold in many nurseries. Do not eat any part of these. They are not the same. Remember, taxonomy has its limits and only the standard form of this plant has a history of being eaten. The standard variety used for food can be found on ebay or etsy.</p><p>In my climate both bac ha and certain hardy varieties of taro can be grown as perennials. That being said, when grown this way they do not sprout until very late and do not produce very much. Therefore if any substantial harvest is desired they should be grown as annuals and transplanted. This is why I have it listed as an annual.</p><p>Plants in this genus are very closely related to those in the Alocasia genus, some of which are used as food as well. Bac Ha is often incorrectly identified as coming from this genus. I don't think any Alocasia species are cultivated for food in temperate climates.</p><p>🦕<i> This plant is featured in a polyculture.</i></p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/ucu1cic20gcn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. esculenta.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/qln6efh76csm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. gigantea.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Crepidiastrum Sonchifolium 'Goddeulbbaegi' '고들빼기' | Biennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: <u>Deer resistant.</u></p><p><b>Status:</b> None. ⚠️</p><p><b>Notes: </b><i>Coming soon.</i></p><p><b>Photos: </b><i>Coming soon.</i></p><p><br></p><h3>Curcuma Longa 'Turmeric' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Rhizome, shoot.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division.

I mean wow, like a totally different vegetable! I try to incorporate as many taprooted plants in my garden as I can because they help improve the soil when allowed to go to seed. Just like radishes and turnips, carrots offer the same benefits. </p><p>The wild carrot, also known as queen anne's lace, is the very same species and is often considered a weed in my area. That's a good indication that carrots will have success naturalizing in the garden. And out of all the annuals/biennials I grow, carrots seem to be one of the best plants suited for this. I was further convinced of the carrot's potential when I was reading <i>The Book Of Herbal Wisdom</i> as follows:</p><blockquote>Wild Carrot grows in heavy grasses, where it is difficult for the little barbed seeds to penetrate the turf. And yet they do, so that the plant proliferates widely in heavy turf as well as bare ground. It is like a needle piercing through.</blockquote><p>The domesticated carrot still retains some of these wonderful qualities, able to germinate and grow even among tough competition. This is a refreshing quality for such a common root vegetable when others, and I am particularly thinking of those in the mustard family like turnips or radishes, have such a persistent preference for bare soil. It is also very tolerant of heat and dry soil so it withstands our summers with ease. It truly does not wish to bolt until it has reached a certain size or grown for long enough. It really is a tough plant. So the carrot certainly belongs in the wild garden and has the potential to grow and propagate with very little maintenance. </p><p>The carrot family is full of poisonous lookalikes, so always be sure of your identification. Let best plants go to seed, harvest others before flowering.</p><p><u>Suggested Varieties:</u> 'Over The Rainbow Carrot Mix' from <a href="https://store.experimentalfarmnetwork.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Experimental Farm Network</a>.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/9htj0rndubeq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">D. carota sativa.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Dioscorea Batatas 'Chinese Yam' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber, leaf, aerial tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Aerial tuber. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">CLIMBING</b> <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">SPREADS AGGRESSIVELY</b></p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, preferred.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established. ✅</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Most yams are only grown in tropical climates and would be annuals in temperate climates, but this species is particularly cold hardy. The tuber extends very deep into the earth, often over a foot long, and sends up a climbing vine with beautiful, heart-shapes leaves. When the plant is old enough, small aerial tubers form at the leaf nodes. These fall to the ground after the leaves die back, and sprout to become new plants. So the aerial tubers are edible in exactly the same way as the main tuber. They do spread very easily and can become invasive, so be sure to contain them. </p><p>The root is usually harvested after 2-3 years. It is very fragile and cannot be pulled out of the ground, so without any soil preparation beforehand it would have to be excavated. Because of this, you may need to plant them in some form of perforated bag or container, or even in plastic drainage pipes buried in the ground. A trellis is also necessary to provide something for the vine to climb on.

I am currently experimenting with a planting pattern that allows the potatoes to stay in the ground to be harvested as needed. When harvesting, one potato from each plant should be replanted to wait in the ground over winter until the following spring. This pattern allows me to grow other crops that need the entire growing season alongside the potatoes. It also limits the soil disturbance. However the longer potatoes are kept in the ground, the greater the chance they will succumb to disease, insects/rodents or rot. So finding the right variety for this method will be essential. Well-draining soil will help prevent rot, while a diverse planting will help prevent disease and insects.

The seedlings start out very small but once they get going they don't stop! These plants produce tons of edible leaves and a giant inflorescence packed with dense, shiny seeds. I prefer this plant over other seed options for a few reasons. First, it's very easy to harvest. The plants are big and each contains a huge amount of seeds, so you get way more of a harvest per plant compared to many other grains. Second, the seeds don't need any husking or processing aside from separating the chaff out. They are pretty much good to go right off the plant. And finally, along with a generous amount of seed, the plant produces huge stems that make top notch mulch. We are feeding ourselves and the soil at the same time.</p><p>To the best of my knowledge amaranth was a staple crop of equal importance to maize in many regions of America, but Spanish colonialists outlawed it due to its use in religious rituals. This is the reason everyone associates maize with native american agriculture but not amaranth.</p><p>Best transplanted or if direct seeding, clear and prepare soil beforehand. When harvesting amaranth I like to leave a little bit of stem standing up in the ground, still attached to its roots.

All this makes it an excellent choice for quickly regenerating poor soil.</p><p>The plants are quite tall and therefore make a natural companion for vining edibles. If they are not planted densely they are more likely to bend over from the wind, but few of them seem to break. And because the leaves are relatively small and stay close to the stem, this plant creates very little shade. </p><p>Kenaf varieties are generally categorized by how quickly they flower, although I do not pretend to understand the nuances of that scheme. But the general tradeoff is that earlier flowering types are less productive and grow to be shorter plants. If collecting seed be cautious with the dried pods as they can be prickly and painful.</p><p>I am excited to continue researching how they can be incorporated into regenerative food systems. The leaves of this plant can be eaten but <b>H. sabdariffa</b> is the standard for using as a vegetable and grows much smaller.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/n4p0ji80ca8j" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">H. cannabinum.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Hordeum Vulgare 'Barley' | Annual 🖤</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Seed. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">CALORIE CROP</b></p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">SOIL REGENERATION</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: <u>Deer resistant.</u> Seeds fed to turkeys and chickens.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established. ✅</p><p><b>Notes:</b> The food of ancient Roman gladiators!

Young leaves can also be eaten as a vegetable. Grows as a die-back vine, likes to clamber or climb, and tips can root when touching the soil. Will produce more shoots every year it is in the ground.</p><p>I think this plant has amazing potential for the forest garden because in temperate climates there is absolutely nothing else like it. It also tolerates fairly deep shade and is low maintenance. There are, however, a few difficulties. First, the seeds do not germinate easily. They should be scarified and soaked but even then it's not a sure bet. In the ground they may take months or over a year to germinate. You will also need both a male and female plant to produce fruit. So that means you'll have to grow out at least 3 seedlings to have a good chance. But once these hurdles are overcome the possibilities are very exciting. <b>T. pilosa</b> is another species that is likely cold hardy (I haven't grown it yet). <i>Plants For Human Consumption</i> writes the following: 'Fruits may be edible (tanaka)'.

The fruits can be eaten fresh while the pads must be cooked. Incredibly resilient, carefree and an underutilized vegetable here in the sates. </p><p>When considering this plant, it is important to understand the difference between spines and glochids. Most forms have spines, these are the large and sharp needles that stab you. Some forms are spineless, and these are what I prefer to cultivate as it makes my life easier and they are less dangerous in the garden. However, I am not aware of any forms for any species that do not have any glochids. Glochids are invisible barbed hairs that are found all over the pads and fruit. Touching them can be mildly painful although they are usually easy to pull out if it's only a few. Because of this, even if the form is spineless it is still not safe to touch the cactus. Use gloves or preferably tongs when handling cacti in this genus. After harvesting, thoroughly wash and scrub every inch of the cactus or fruit to remove the glochids. They are also removed through cooking but I would still be sure to do it beforehand as well.</p><p>This species is a standard in cultivation. It survives the cold by releasing some of the water stored in its pads before freezing weather arrives. The pads become shriveled, preventing them from freezing. This is healthy and they will perk back up come spring time. <b>O. cacanapa</b> has larger pads, doesn't shrivel and is less cold hardy. It died over winter in a pot, I doubt it would survive even in the ground. It is also a lighter blue color which is pretty. <b>O. stricta</b> may also be suitable for cold winters but I haven't tested it. Many other cold hardy species used for food.

This tree has incredible potential for creative integration into the permaculture landscape.</p><p>🦕<i> This plant is featured in a polyculture.</i></p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/26mpfikd4un4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">P. tomentosa.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Symphytum Uplandicum 'Comfrey' | Perennial 🖤</h3><p><b>Support: </b>Mulch, shade.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">EASY &amp; VIGOROUS</b> <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">SOIL REGENERATION</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.

The real wonder of this plant is its deep roots which help cycle nutrients from lower down in the ground back to the topsoil when the leaves are mulched. Many varieties produce fertile seed and are known to spread aggressively. However 'Bocking 14' is a sterile variety and for that reason is quite common. I grow this one right by my compost pile, the idea being that its roots will catch some of the nutrients draining off into the soil. Because this variety is sterile is must be transplanted, by root fragment or preferably crown. </p><p>🦕<i> This plant is featured in a polyculture.</i></p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/u2q6rbfmpbdi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">S. uplandicum.</a></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>If you would learn to be subservient to the king you would not have to live on lentils. -Aristippus</i></p><p><i>If you would learn to live on lentils you would not have to be subservient to the king. -Diogenes</i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Deer Resistant Food Plants</h2><p>For quick reference here is a list of all the plants from the list above that I have found to be resistant to browsing by deer. Different deer eat different things at different times of year, so there is no way to guarantee anything. That being said, these have proven themselves in my garden which gets visited by many deer dozens of times a year. Some may get nibbled (especially if the plant is very young) but if they are on this list it means they can usually grow without being fenced off.

Calories may not be the best symbol of how our food sustains us, but it's an easy way to compare crops. These tables are a work in progress and I am still discovering what the expected yields should be.</p><p>The tables below include selected crops with available nutritional information, a rough estimate of their caloric value, and possible yields per plants based on decent growing conditions in my climate. I like to think about energy per plant because that is how I tend to break things down in my head, but this does not take into account time or space. Some of these plants require the full growing season to maximize yields (like achira and sunchoke) and some only need a few months (like radishes and turnips). Many other useful crops that take longer than one growing season to harvest are ommited.</p><p><br></p><table tableid="e6fe34b2" columns="4" style="--columns: 4; --rows: 18;" rows="18" class=""><tr><td class=""><b>Roots</b></td><td class=""><b>Calories/Pound</b></td><td class=""><b>Pounds/Plant</b></td><td class=""><b>Calories/Plant</b></td></tr><tr><td class="">Achira</td><td class="">370</td><td class="">6</td><td class="">2220</td></tr><tr><td class="">Sunchoke</td><td class="">330</td><td class="">5 [?]</td><td class="">1650 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Mashua</td><td class="">310</td><td class="">4 [?]</td><td class="">1240 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Taro</td><td class="">500</td><td class="">2 [?]</td><td class="">1000 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Sweet Potato</td><td class="">380</td><td class="">2</td><td class="">760</td></tr><tr><td class="">Potato</td><td class="">350</td><td class="">2</td><td class="">700</td></tr><tr><td class="">Oca</td><td class="">330</td><td class="">1</td><td class="">330</td></tr><tr><td class="">Leek</td><td class="">270</td><td class="">1 [?]</td><td class="">270 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Burdock</td><td class="">400</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">200 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Parsnip</td><td class="">340</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">170 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Garlic</td><td class="">670</td><td class="">0.2 [?]</td><td class="">130 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Salsify</td><td class="">370</td><td class="">0.2 [?]</td><td class="">70 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Radish</td><td class="">70</td><td class="">1 [?]</td><td class="">70 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Carrot</td><td class="">190</td><td class="">0.3 [?]</td><td class="">60 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Turnip</td><td class="">120</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">60 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Crosne</td><td class="">330</td><td class="">0.2 [?]</td><td class="">60 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Bunching Onion</td><td class="">150</td><td class="">0.3 [?]</td><td class="">40 [?]</td></tr></table><p><br></p><table tableid="3d741e14" columns="4" style="--columns: 4; --rows: 8;" rows="8" class=""><tr><td class=""><b>Seeds</b></td><td class=""><b>Calories/Pound</b></td><td class=""><b>Pounds/Plant</b></td><td class=""><b>Calories/Plant</b></td></tr><tr><td class="">Amaranth</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">750 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Sorghum</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">750 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Maize</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">750 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Quinoa</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">750 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Sunflower</td><td class="">2600</td><td class="">0.2 [?]</td><td class="">520 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Runner Bean</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.2 [?]</td><td class="">300 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Barley</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.01 [?]</td><td class="">15 [?]</td></tr></table><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Storage</h2><p>My ideal form of storage for root crops is none at all - allowing plants to remain in the ground until they are ready to be eaten. I also actively select for plants that can stay alive as long as possible so I don't need to worry about storing them and can instead harvest them as needed. But storing is often necessary to keep the pantry stocked or simply to prevent non-hardy plants from dying over winter. There are generally two primary methods:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><b>Roots that keep well. </b>Brush off most dirt but do not scrub with water. Cure and allow skin to dry out a bit in a dark place. Store in breathable bag or box in a cool and humid environment. A cellar is best and that is typically the environment we are trying to imitate. I use this method for most annuals/biennials (like turnips and carrots) and many perennials that are grown as annuals (like potato, taro and mashua).</li><li><b>Roots that keep poorly.</b> Brush off most dirt but do not scrub with water. Do not allow roots to dry out. Store in slightly damp medium (like moss, wood shavings, sand or coco fiber) inside a breathable bag or box. Ensure medium remains moist enough that roots do not dry out but aerated enough that mold does not grow. Check on roots regularly. I use this method mainly for perennials that are grown as annuals (like achira and some gingers).</li></ol><p><br></p><p>When storing marginally-hardy roots in the ground over winter it can be helpful to leave them in the same location they've been growing the entire season, with their root system attached. They are often more likely to survive this way than if you had dug them up, divided and replanted them. With tubers (like potato or sunchoke) this is irrelevant, but for all other types of roots it may prove useful. Warmer micro-climates, mulch and well-draining soil also helps.</p><p>Aside from roots the rest is fairly simple. Seeds or grains are easy to store and should be kept in a dark and dry environment after being cleaned. Leafy vegetables can be wrapped in a slightly moist cloth and refrigerated or blanched and frozen. Other methods of storage like drying or fermenting can signficantly expand the lifespan of many vegetables.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>They insist upon no government higher than that of the individual, while they leave in existence those causes which imperatively demand, and will always demand so long as they exist, the intervention of just such restrictive governments as we now have. </i></p><p><i>-Stephen Pearl Andrews</i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>These are some of the self-assembled equipment I use in the garden. I typically look for simple solutions that are relatively cheap and can be replicated easily.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Seeding Shovel </b>| <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/sdb6g60lm364" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Photos</a></p><p><i>Shovel, plastic tubing, funnels, zip ties.</i></p><p>I thought up this design because I was frustrated at the lack of seeding tools for compacted soil. They are all designed for soil that is already very loose and usually tilled in advance. But what if I want to seed right into existing vegetation, or don't want to clear away any mulch? In the past I've just bent down and used a hori hori, placing each seed by hand, but this is tedious and physically demanding. This design allows me to stay standing up and plant multiple seeds at a time, making everything much quicker. Small plastic tubing (big enough for seeds of your choice to fit through) is zip tied to the back of the shovel, from about halfway down the metal end to the bottom of the handle. If your tubing is small it will be necessary to attach funnels to drop the seeds into. With larger tubing this isn't necessary and this way it will also work with large seeds like barley or buckwheat. When using this it is important to plant the shovel in the ground and then push it away from you before dropping the seeds down. This creates a narrow gap in the soil that the seeds can then fall into. So far the results have been mixed and this method only works with seeds that don't need sunlight to germinate. But I have grown barley and buckwheat successfully with this tool.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Deer Fencing </b>| <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/dpmh4qc2tg8h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Photos</a></p><p><i>Metal fencing, tent stakes, caribeeners.</i></p><p>This is the setup I use for most of my trees to protect them from deer. Steel welded-wire fencing that is 5-6 feet tall is wrapped in a circle around the tree. Cheap carabiners keep the fencing clasped shut (I use 3 per fence). Tent stakes hold the fencing down - place them right next to where the fence closes and directly opposite this point on the other side of the fence. You may need 2 or 3 in each spot depending on the soil. This keeps the fence in place but also allows us to undo the clasps and open it up for maintenance. Posts can be placed around the interior and attached to the fence for extra stability. This is a good idea if the fencing is being used to section off an area of the garden but not always neccessary when wrapped around trees. I like this fencing system because it is very straightforward and can be assembled or taken apart quickly. This system is not designed for animals that will push up against the fence or otherwise mess with it (whereas deer are typically very gentle).</p><p><br></p><p><b>Germination Tray  </b>| <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/oa6thv5v949t" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Photos</a></p><p><i>Shallow tub, metal caging.</i></p><p>I like using large, shallow containers for germinating seeds as I find them easier to work with than individual pots (although I use those too). I drill some holes in the bottom so water can drain out and then fill them with soil. If I need to keep track of different seeds, I can sow them in lines and use handwritten labels. Then I will place a metal cage over it to prevent rodents or birds from digging around in the soil. I use the kind that attaches to guinea pig or hamster enclosures but anything similar will work. These can often be found used on craigslist and are a good investment (if they come with a tray that can hold a few inches of soil all the better). In the spring or fall they can be out in the sun but in the summer I like to keep them in the shade so seedlings don't get burned and the soil stays moist.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>The farmer who works the earth merely loves the thought of himself laboring in the fields... if your love for nature is superficial and what you do amounts simply to making use of farming for your own purposes, the road will be closed off to you.... </i></p><p><i>-Masanobu Fukuoka</i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Notable Reference Books</h2><p>My favorite English reference books that are only available in print (although some can only be purchased used).

the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out.</i></p><p><i>There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by... watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.” </i></p><p><i>- John Steinbeck</i></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Still Looking</h2><p>These are some plants I am interested in cultivating but have not found any sources for.
