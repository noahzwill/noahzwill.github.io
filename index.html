<h1>Crop Research </h1><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Stretching my arm towards the sky, I find breakfast.  Lowering my hand to the ground, I find lunch.  Burying my fist in the earth, I find dinner. </i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>The 6th great extinction is here. Climate collapse is unstoppable. Civilization can no longer support us. Research into resilient crops for food security in temperate climates. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Philosophy</h2><p><br></p><p>Everyday I ask myself, what should I do? As our planet barrels towards an uninhabitable future and our governments become more repressive, what can I do to stop all this? The most important realization, I think, is that none of us are going to change the world. We are not going to save the planet from another extinction (it's already happening). We are not going to save the billions of human and non-human lives that will perish. An ecological socialist utopia is exactly that, a utopia. It's simply not going to happen within our lifetimes, or possibly ever. The destructive power of civilization, both physical and psychological, has been growing for thousands of years now. History has made it very clear time and time again - as a species we are not prepared to overcome this sociological phenomenon. And so we live in a very interesting time, perhaps one of the few generations of humans to witness earth during the momentous shift climate collapse is causing. Nothing like this has ever happened in the entire history of humanity.</p><p>In the face of all this, why do I spend my time researching and growing food? I wish I could do more, believe me. I wish I could stop the murder, the torture, the enslavement, the destruction. But realistically, my influence will be quite limited. I believe having a relationship with nature is one of the most direct ways for anyone to feel satisfied, loved and empowered. And only individuals engaged with nature are capable of forming communities that truly provide for our physical, social and spiritual needs. These communities then have the potential to be the building blocks of a new society, to form a federation of semi-autonomous tribes. Keeping land at the forefront of both individual and societal success is an effective path forward because it is meaningful at every level - whether you just want to not hate the world, or you want to improve the living conditions of your community, or you want to build a new society. Ultimately, all we are fighting for is a peaceful relationship with the land and with each other.</p><p>My work here is an attempt to discover resilient and productive crops that can be easily organized into self-sustaining systems. Growing food for yourself doesn't have to be hard, lots of vegetables even grow like weeds! Grass lawns were once a symbol of wealth, yet now they sit in front of even the most impoverished homes. This paradox was intentionally designed through generations of propaganda. I would like to be able to offer an easy way out, a way for anyone to grow lots of food and medicine on whatever land they have access to. I want to learn from these plants, to understand how they want to grow. I don't want to impose any standards on them, just to watch and see what they do. I want to help them. Only then will the symphony begin.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Nurseries </h2><p><br></p><p><a href="http://sacredsucculents.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sacred Succulents</a></p><p><a href="https://oikostreecrops.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Oikos Tree Crops</a></p><p><a href="https://store.experimentalfarmnetwork.org/collections/perennial-vegetables" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Experimental Farm Network</a></p><p><a href="http://www.wildgardenseed.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wild Garden Seed</a></p><p><a href="https://www.cultivariable.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cultivariable</a></p><p><a href="https://www.garlicana.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Garlicana</a></p><p><a href="https://kykeonplants.mysimplestore.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kykeon Plants</a></p><p><a href="https://www.kitazawaseed.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kitazawa Seed</a></p><p><a href="https://www.burntridgenursery.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Burnt Ridge Nursery</a></p><p><a href="https://www.grandprismaticseed.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grand Prismatic Seed</a></p><p><a href="https://www.prairiemoon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prairie Moon Nursery</a></p><p><a href="http://www.vendio.com/stores/Polynesian_Produce_Stand/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Polynesian Produce</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/usr/lupinaster" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Scirpidiella's Plants</a></p><p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/SmallIslandSeedCo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Small Island Seed</a></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Guide</h2><p><br></p><p><b>Annual/Perennial: </b>Designations for Zone 7, may differ in other climates. Annuals are usually more interesting to me if they can reseed themselves (less work for me).</p><p><b>Edible:</b> Useful edible parts. Not comprehensive, not a reference, only a starting point. Do not eat anything you are not 100% familiar with. Always consult a real source.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Useful methods of propagation. Usually seed, stem cutting, or rhizome/tuber. Seeds that prefer cold straitifcation are often noted as such. Usually I try to get potted plants if a seed is difficult to germinate, but I do have lots of pots with soil and seed that sit in my greenhouse for however many seasons it takes for them to germinate.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Rough guidelines for minimum sun requirements. Deep shade (≈70%) → Shade (≈50%) → Part Shade (≈30%) → Sun (≈10%). I usually find that plants do alright with less sun than what is typically suggested.</p><p><b>Wildlife:</b> Impact of wildlife on plant. We have lots of deer as well as chipmunks, rabbits and birds that live nearby. I try to grow enough food for everyone, but I can't let them eat everything!</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Everything else. Observations about growth habits, useful varieties, hardiness, harvesting, interactions with other plants and more. Plants with photos were grown in Maryland, roughly Z7. Winters have been mild lately, only a few inches of snow and some ice. Plenty of rain most of the year, although the ground can dry out in the summer. Soil has poor-drainage and some clay, but is mostly good.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Herbs</h2><p><br></p><h3>Anethum Graveolens 'Dill' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Will bolt from too much heat, but even then you could get two consecutive crops if you wanted. A thin and tall plant that doesn't create shade, so it is easy to grow in small gaps. Good pollinator and great seed production, should reseed itself easily. Useful herb for pickling.</p><p><br></p><h3>Artemisia spp. 'Mugwort' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>A. vulgaris is common mugwort, A. princeps is japanese mugwort, many other edible and medicinal varieties. Seems to grow quite easily, should be great for shady spots. Said to be a lucid dreaming aid, can be infused as tea or smoked.</p><p><br></p><h3>Asarum spp. 'Wild Ginger' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Rhizome.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed. Cold stratify.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Some species in this genus have edible rhizomes, although use with caution as there are reports of toxicity. Leaves are poisonous. A. canadense seems to be most commonly sold here, but A. europaeum is also used the same way. Doesn't seem particularly worthwhile given the limited use and potential toxicity. Beautiful groundcover for shady spots though.</p><p><br></p><h3>Chenopodium Ambrosioides 'Epazote' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Mexican herb that grows and reseeds itself easily. Not the most versatile herb given its aroma. May be useful as deer deterrent. </p><p><br></p><h3>Cryptotaenia spp. 'Honewort' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?    </p><p><b>Notes: </b>C. canadensis is American variety, C. japonica (known as mitsuba) is Asian variety. C. japonica is sometimes confused with Oenanthe javanica, they can both be called Japanese parsley. Cryptotaenia is a much hardier species though. </p><p><br></p><h3>Foeniculum Vulgare 'Fennel' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, stem.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Hardy perennial herb.</p><p><br></p><h3>Lavandula Angustifolia 'Lavender' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes:</b> Compact herb that grows similar to rosemary and is just as easily propagated. Limited culinary use but may be useful for its wonderful aroma when making hygiene products such as soap.</p><p><br></p><h3>Mentha spp. 'Mint' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>M. requienii (corsican mint) is the only species I've come across that forms a good groundcover. Others, like peppermint and spearmint, will grow taller and do well in almost any conditions. Not preferable for garden beds, may be better suited where it can be given space and managed easily. I put some spearmint in a compacted lawn with poor soil and mowed over it at least once, yet it still seems to be doing just fine. I like planting mints in shady spots as it slows down the growth and doesn't take space away from other plants that need more sun.</p><p><br></p><h3>Origanum Vulgare 'Oregano' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Low growing varieties make easy and useful ground covers, can spread a few feet in one season. Easy herb for shady areas. Greek variety better for culinary use but prefers more sun.</p><p><br></p><h3>Perilla Frutescens 'Shiso' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, inflorescence. </p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Reseeds itself easily.</p><p><br></p><h3>Porophyllum Ruderale 'Quillquiña' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Mexican herb.</p><p><br></p><h3>Pycnanthemum spp. 'Mountain Mint' |  Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Similar to common mints but has a thinner leaf with a much more potent mint aroma/taste. Limited culinary usage but may be good in teas. May be useful for hygienic purposes, it is a good breath freshener. </p><p><br></p><h3>Salvia Rosmarinus 'Rosemary' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Prefers full sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes:</b> A compact herb with many culinary uses. Grows better in full sun but it will be fine in shadier areas, albeit a bit etiolated. Prefers well-drained soil but seems to be quite flexible. Propagation is easy, cut a few inches off the tip, remove some of the bottom leaves, place in water until roots form and then pot. From a single reasonably sized plant you could easily get a dozen cuttings over the course of one season, making it a great plant to put all over the garden if you plan to use it a lot.</p><p><br></p><h3>Salvia Verbenaca 'Sage' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Many varieties of sage plants can be eaten. This wild species should be a vigorous grower. </p><h3><br></h3><h3>Tagetes spp. 'Marigold' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>T. lucida, often referred to as mexican terragon. T. minuta, peruvian herb known as huacatay. Hopefully can reseed themselves.</p><p><br></p><h3>Thymus spp. 'Thyme' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>T. vulgaris is the standard, grows similar to oregano, easy for culinary use. T. praecox is the creeping species and forms a dense ground cover, may be preferable for filling in gaps between plants as it won't compete as much.</p><h2><br></h2><hr><p><br></p><h2>Roots + Tubers</h2><p><br></p><h3>Althaea Officinalis 'Marshmallow' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed. Cold stratify.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Good potential as root crop although typically has more specific culinary uses than others on this list. Leaves and roots have good medicinal applications for relieving soar throat and coughs.</p><p><br></p><h3>Apios Americana 'Groundnut' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed. Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Grows easily and vigorously, spreading by rhizome, great for shady spots with something to climb on. Some varieties are bushier while some prefer to climb. There can be big differences in edible root size between varieties. Nitrogen fixer.</p><p><br></p><h3>Beta Trigyna 'Turkish Wild Beet' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>A little-known perennial alternative to the common beet. This species is said to have edible roots. Very little information available. Culinary appeal is uncertain.</p><p><br></p><h3>Brassica Rapa Rapa 'Turnip' | Biennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b></p><p><br></p><h3>Chaerophyllum Bulbosum 'Root Chervil' | Biennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. Cold tratify.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b></p><p><br></p><h3>Codonopsis spp. 'Dang Shen' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. Protect early growth from heat and frost.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Many varieties with edible roots. C. pilosula, chinese medicinal vine (Z7). C. lanceolata, korean culinary vine (Z7). C. bulleyana and  C. meleagris, hardy upright plant (Z4). C. clematidea and C. cardiophylla, hardy vine (Z4). Generally likes some shade as the young growth can be sensitive to heat and frost. Tubers grow larger every year, often harvested at 2-3 years old. Amazing potential as a root crop for the forest garden, especially the vining varieties. Plant dies back in winter, is not too aggressive and prefers its feet in the shade. All of this makes it a perfect candidate for climbing on bushes and trees without strangling them.</p><p><br></p><h3>Daucus Carota Sativa 'Carrot' | Biennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b></p><p><br></p><h3>Dioscorea Polystachya 'Chinese Yam' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber, aerial tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, aerial tuber.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Aerial tubers can spread and propagate themselves easily, best planted in a spot where it cannot escape and where management is easy. Roots are fragile, should be grown in bag or tube that can be easily dug up without disturbing root. Plastic drainage pipes may work well when buried half-way into the ground, this is the method I will be trying. Root takes about 2-3 years to harvest, aerial tubers are good crop until then. If growing for aerial tuber crop, best to set aside some roots to leave in ground indefinitely, as older roots will produce more and larger aerial tubers. Needs a large trellis to climb on. D. japonica is the Japanese species, fairly similar.</p><p><br></p><h3>Helianthus Tuberosus 'Sunchoke' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, seed. Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Vigorous grower, great for poor soils. Best planted in a spot where it cannot escape and where management is easy. Roots contain large amounts of inulin. Keeping roots in ground during winter will help reduce this, as will certain methods of preparation (such as pickling/fermenting). May be useful as living barrier, some varieties can grow 10+ feet. H. strumosus and H. giganteus can be grown similarly and have edible roots as well.</p><p><br></p><h3>Lepidium Meyenii 'Maca' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Can be difficult to grow outside of its native environment. Uncertain how long root can stay in ground.</p><p><br></p><h3>Oxalis Tuberosa 'Oca' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber, leaf, stem.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, stem, seed. Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Shelter from heat.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Tubers form during short days in late fall. Some varieties tuberize a week earlier, you may get better yields from these. Tubers may be overwintered in ground in Z7 and above, potential to move around garden. After sending up shoots in the spring, tuber will dissolve. Stems are tart and sour but edible, may be useful as perennial greens if you can find a good way to prepare them. Stems can be propagated easily, put them in some water and many roots will quickly form. This method of propagation may be useful for rapidly multiplying potted plants before the season starts.</p><p><br></p><h3>Petroselinum Crispum Tuberosum 'Parsley Root' | Biennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b></p><p><br></p><h3>Platycodon Grandiflorus 'Balloon Flower' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>It appears only some varieties are used for edible root production. The root is called doraji, so look for this when purchasing. In the same family as Codonopsis species, will produce edible roots in a similar fashion. Upright growth.</p><p><br></p><h3>Psoralea Esculenta 'Breadroot' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Will take 2-3 years until harvest similar to Chinese yam and codonopsis, but mature root size looks to be much smaller. Nitrogen fixer.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Raphanus Sativus 'Radish' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in sun. Useful cover crop for breaking up and improving hard soil if left in ground to decompose.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Solanum spp. 'Potato' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, seed. Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive. I think the chipmunk has dug a few up.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Establishing a perennial potato patch poses two main problems: disease pressure builds up over the years and tubers may not survive a winter dormancy when left in the ground. Wild potatoes do not suffer from these problems because they are often resistant to both disease and frost, but many wild potatoes are either not safe to eat and/or difficult to harvest. Wild potatoes are also able to spread multiple feet each year via tubers attached to long stolons, allowing them to move around as they grow. Domestication has made potatoes more stationary and more edible but has also weakened their resistances. Finding domesticated species that maintain some of their wild genetics while still being easy to harvest and edible seems to be the best way to incorporate perennial potato patches into forest gardens. Allowing the tubers to move around the garden will also likely significantly improve disease resistance, as they won't be stuck in the same patch of soil year after year. Some species form tubers during short days in fall and some are day-neutral. Short day potatoes are less productive and have a limited harvest window, but for those same reasons may also be less prone to wildlife interference. S. curtilobum and&nbsp;S. ajanhuiri have good frost-resistance and dormancy, so I will be attempting to establish perennial patches of these.</p><p><br></p><h3>Stachys Affinis 'Chinese Artichoke' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy and vigorous root crop, spreading by rhizomes. Beautiful small tubers that overwinter easily after top dies back. One of the smaller tubers on this list but should produce a good amount of them without any attention.</p><p><br></p><h3>Ullucus Tuberosus 'Ulloco' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Shelter from heat.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Tubers form during short days in late fall. Tubers may be overwintered in ground, potential to move around garden. Difficult to grow in hot weather. Leaves can be used like spinach, may be useful as perennial greens. Tubers are supposedly hardier than oca and should survive Z7 winters easily.</p><h2><br></h2><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Onions</h2><h3><br></h3><h3>Allium Ampeloprasum 'Leek' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b></p><h1><br></h1><h3>Allium Cepa Aggregatum 'Potato Onion' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, seed.

Most varieties will not set seed and propagation by bulb is easiest. Green mountain should be a high-yielding cultivar. Potato onions or walking onions would be my first choices when choosing which onions to grow.</p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Cepa Proliferum 'Walking Onion' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf, bulbet.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, bulbet.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to propagate, simply toss bulbets around garden or divide the bulbs at the base of the plant. Varieties with larger bulbets may be preferable if using them directly as food, there seems to be noticeable differences in bulbet size between some varieties. Some varieties have sharper tasting leaves than others. </p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Fistulosum 'Bunching Onion' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Useful as another form of scallion, will multiple easily and patches can be divided for propagation. Best to find varieties that are suitably cold hardy for your climate in order to establish a perennial patch. </p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Oschaninii 'Grey Shallot' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>The only true shallot, originally found growing wild in China. Not the same as Allium cepa, which are also referred to as shallots. Good potential for perennial patch.</p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Sativum 'Garlic' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf, bulbet.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, bulbet.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to propagate via bulbs or aerial bulbets, although the bulbets will take longer to produce a good crop.

Trigyna, this perennial beet relative is grown for its edible leaves. Some reports indicate the root is edible as well. I have yet to see anyone harvest the root, I will have to try it for myself. Leaves should be tasty.</p><p><br></p><h3>Brassica Oleracea 'Kale' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, inflorescence.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Stem, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Will grow in shade but gets leggy.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant, except in winter. Bunnies nibble on leaves, but typically don't damage more than a few. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Perennial grex provides good variety, option to select for desirable traits. Thicker leafed plants less sensitive to insects, although may be less palatable. Susceptible to cabbage worm. Should be spaced apart to prevent crowding (plants can spread 3 feet in diameter) and limit insect spread. Should be interplanted with trap crops and pollinator plants to minimize damage. Despite the wildlife and insect pressure, plants always seem to bounce back just fine. To propagate by stem simply place it in some water until roots form (may take a while) and then pot it.</p><p><br></p><h3>Brassica Rapa Purpurea 'Hon Tsai Tai' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, stem, inflorescence.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Fast growing, self-seeding and easy to get established.

Young inflorescence edible as well. Produces lots of seed.</p><p><br></p><h3>Claytonia spp. 'Miner's Lettuce' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, stem, inflorescence.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Beautiful and delicious ground cover for shady spots, self seeds once established, all above ground parts edible and delicious. C. perfoliata is most commonly available, and sometimes C. sibirica. Even within these species there seems to be a great deal of variation. Some other species in the genus are edible as well, some of the most gorgeous plants I've ever seen. Would be worth more research.</p><p><br></p><h3>Colocasia Esculenta 'Taro' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Corm, stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Corm.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to shade. Wet soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Stems provide wonderful, spongy perennial vegetable unlike anything else. All parts of plant contain calcium oxalate, so must be cooked thoroughly to be safe to eat. Preparation varies, best to do research beforehand. Useful for wet and shady areas. Some varieties are cold hardy to Z7 and perhaps lower. Can grow over 5 feet tall, good potential to be interplanted with shade-tolerant vining plants that can climb on its long stems (perhaps groundnut, codonopsis or jiaogulan). Will flower in right conditions but doesn't seem to in this climate.</p><p><br></p><h3>Cynara Cardunculus 'Cardoon' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, stem, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Cardoon is globe artichoke's primitive and hardy cousin. Artichoke should survive in my climate but for now cardoon will suffice. Flower petals are said to be edible in same way as artichoke but I cannot imagine anyone bothering with that given how much smaller they are. The heart of the flower should be the main crop here, although stems have a long history of use, maybe good for soup. For an annual alternative, see sunflowers further down.</p><p><br></p><h3>Diplotaxis Tenuifolia 'Wild Rocket' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, stem, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>There are a few genera with species that get referred to as cress or rocket, so it's easy to get confused. This is a standard perennial form that's easy to find. Used in moderation as the taste can be sharp. Should do well in shade.</p><p><br></p><h3>Dystaenia Takesimana 'Seombadi' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. Germination is generally poor.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Leaves supposedly taste like celery.</p><p><br></p><h3>Galinsoga Parviflora 'Gallant Soldier' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. </p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>If you are looking for a vegetable that grows like a weed, this is it. The plant can reseed itself very quickly and it grows abundantly. Flowers are edible but may not be palatable. Preferable in areas where it won't overtake other plants of interest. </p><p><br></p><h3>Glebionis Coronaria 'Shungiku' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, stem, flower bud.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to get established and should self-seed. Milder flavored varieties better suited as vegetable.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Gynostemma Pentaphyllum 'Jiaogulan' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Good herb for shady spots or thickets, great potential for food forest. Most reports discuss the medicinal benefits of drinking as a tea, but it seems the leaves can also just be eaten as a vegetable or potherb. Not very cold hardy, will see if it survives here. Unclear if a single plant can produce seed.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Hemerocallis</b> spp. 'Daylily' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Deep shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, only eat flowers though.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>There is much drama about daylilies online, many people seem to have bad reactions despite a long history of edible use. Supposedly all species are fine, but the general recommendation is to stick to the classic orange ditch lily, H. fulva, or other species with a history of being eaten, such as H. middendorffii. Practically every part of the plant is edible, but may not be worthwhile. Daylily flowers are eaten as buds or fully opened. Traditionally they are often dried or pickled, both of which should make them more digestible. Daylilies are easy to grow and seem to do fine in fairly deep shade.</p><p><br></p><h3>Hosta spp. 'Hosta' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, one of their favorites. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Many species but only some historically used for vegetables. Supposedly all are edible but probably best to get the well known species if not interested in experimenting. Young shoots (and very young leaves) make unique vegetables, cut once and then allow plant to grow. Tolerant of most conditions. Useful for deep shade where edible options are limited. Although the deer love it, there shouldn't be a problem harvesting the shoots as they typically only eat it later on in the growth cycle.</p><p><br></p><h3>Ligularia Fischeri 'Gomchwi' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. Germination seems poor. Cold stratify?</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>A popular leafy vegetable in Korea, often used as a wrap. Amazing potential as a perennial groundcover that can fill in moist and shady spots. Could be planted beneath trees or be interplanted with other shade-tolerant species.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Matteuccia Struthiopteris</b> 'Fiddlehead Fern' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoots.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Consume in moderation and always prepare according to traditional methods, may be harmful in large quantities. Another great edition for shady spots, should spread nicely.</p><p><br></p><h3>Osmorhiza Claytonii 'Sweet Cicely' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. Cold stratify.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>American native.</p><p><br></p><h3>Petasites Japonicus 'Japanese Butterbur' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, flower bud.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed. May be difficult from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Plant has toxic alkaloids, consume in moderation and always prepare according to traditional methods. Can be an aggressive spreader once established, plant where it will not escape and can be easily managed. Useful for wet and shady areas, similar conditions as taro. P. japonicus var. giganteus is a larger variety, growing taller with wider leaves, affect on edible yield is uncertain. Related to P. frigidus, arctic butterbur, which has edible properties as well.</p><p><br></p><h3>Polygonatum spp. 'Solomon's Seal' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Common variety is P. multiflorum, dwarf variety is P. humile, small variety is P. biflorum, fragrant variety is P. odoratum, king's variety is P. commutatum. All supposedly have edible shoots, larger varieties should give you a better yield. Sometimes rhizomes can be found online, these will give you an easier start than seed.</p><p><br></p><h3>Portulaca Oleracea 'Purslane' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Abundant groundcover that should self-seed and spread without much effort. A few different varieties.</p><p><br></p><h3>Rheum spp. 'Rhubarb' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Petiole.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>There are many alternatives to the average garden rhubarb that also have edible leaf petioles (often incorrectly referred to as stalks). R. australe, Himalayan rhubarb. R. nobile, noble rhubarb is a stunning plant with transparent leaves.  </p><p><br></p><h3>Rumex spp. 'Dock/Sorrel' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Common sorrels seem a bit boring to me. R. aplinus produces much larger leaves with a more striking appearance, should produce a larger yield than common sorrel as well. Apparently can be bitter depending on harvest season. Leaf petioles can be used like rhubarb.</p><p><br></p><h3>Sesuvium Verrucosum 'Sea-Purslane' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b></p><p><br></p><h3>Smyrnium spp. 'Alexanders' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, shoot, stem, leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. Cold stratify.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Cultivated by Romans but now largely forgotten, every part of this plant is edible. S. olusatrum is the more well-known species, given the name Alexanders. S. perfoliatum was left out of the naming party but is fairly similar and can be eaten the same way. Perfoliatum has a gorgeous subspecies named rotundifolium. Perfoliatum may also be more palatable, I will have to see. There are other species within this genus that may also be of use but I haven't found any information on them. Amazing potential as a vegetable crop.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Field Crop + Seed</h2><p><br></p><h3>Amaranthus spp. 'Amaranth' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, one of their favorites. Birds enjoy seeds?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. Reseeds itself generously, even without reaching maturity. Plants consistently eaten by deer still produced enough seed to self sow. Seed is easy to harvest and clean, but are small and dense compared to other grains. Some varieties are better for seed production, others are better for edible leaves. Like some others on this list, may not be best for garden bed as it can get weedy, perhaps better suited for a field with other grain crops.</p><p><br></p><h3>Atriplex Hortensis 'Orach' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, one of their favorites.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. Reseeds itself generously. Good species for leaf production, easy spinach substitute.</p><p><br></p><h3>Celosia Argentea 'Plumed Cockscomb' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. Reseeds itself generously. All reports indicate leaves must be cooked. Gorgeous flowers, some reports of young inflorescence being eaten but the specifics of that may depend on the variety. A few different varieties, some growing taller than others. C. trigyna is said to have edible leaves as well but is not worth growing.</p><p><br></p><h3>Chenopodium Nuttalliae 'Huauzontle' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, inflorescence, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, one of their favorites.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. Reseeds itself generously. Unlike other related species, this plant is often used for its edible inflorescence. As far as edible inflorescence production goes, this plant has amazing potential both for it's ease of growth and the quantity a single patch can produce. </p><p><br></p><h3>Helianthus Annuus 'Sunflower' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Flower, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant. Birds enjoy seeds?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. Large edible seeds. The young, unopened flower head can be prepared and eaten as a vegetable similar to artichoke/cardoon heart. Great potential as vegetable, especially for multi-headed varieties. Some have multiple smaller flowers and some have a single large flower. Plants can grow over 10 feet, should make an excellent trellis or barrier.</p><p><br></p><h3>Sorghum Bicolor 'Sorghum' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant. Birds enjoy seeds?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to grow in poor and dry soil. One of the easiest grain to process for backyard gardeners. Leaf structure creates little shade and makes it a good plant for vines to climb on, similar to maize. Stalks can be left in ground after plant dies - potential use as trellis or barrier in the next season. Varieties differ in days to maturity, faster-maturing varieties more suitable for temperate climates.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Medicinal</h2><p><br></p><h3>Silene Capensis 'Xhosa Dream Root' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Root is usually powdered and drunk with water, uncertain of dosage. Most reports I've seen online don't seem to be written by those experienced with lucid dreaming. Unclear if it actually aids lucid dreaming or simply changes the nature of the dream or does something else entirely. Not very cold hardy.</p><p><br></p><h3>Heimia Salicifolia 'Sun Opener' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Leaves are fermented in water and the resulting tea is drunk. Given its name because it can sometimes produce an orange glow in the user's vision. Seeds are tiny.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
