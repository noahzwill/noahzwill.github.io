<h1>Food For The Extinction</h1><p><i>The 6th great extinction is here. Climate collapse is unstoppable. Civilization can no longer sustain us. Research into resilient crops for food security in temperate climates.</i></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>A Path Forward</h2><p>Everyday I ask myself, what should I do? As our planet barrels towards an uninhabitable future, our governments become more repressive and everyday life becomes more dystopian, what can I do to stop all this? The most important realization is that none of us are going to change the world. We are not going to save the planet from another extinction (it's already happening). We are not going to save the billions of human and non-human lives that will perish. Already over 80 billion land animals are killed each year for consumption, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Words cannot do justice to the absolutely immense horrors we are responsible for. This is the nightmare you cannot wake up from. Clinging to some vision of a better future is tempting, but the evidence against this couldn't be more obvious. The destructive power of civilization has been growing for thousands of years now. Behind all the lies about progress is the simple truth: our planet is dying and there is nothing we can do about it. And so we are perhaps one of the few generations of humans to live through the momentous shift climate collapse is causing. Nothing like this has ever happened in the entire history of humanity. Mankind is entering a new era.</p><p>In the face of all this, how can I be of any meaningful service? Why spend my time researching and growing food? I wish I could do more, believe me. I wish I could stop the murder, the torture, the enslavement, the destruction. But realistically, my influence will be quite limited. I believe having a relationship with nature is one of the most direct ways to feel satisfied, loved and empowered. And only individuals engaged with nature are capable of forming communities that truly provide for our physical, social and spiritual needs. When our empire inevitably collapses, these communities have the potential to be the building blocks of a new society, to form a federation of self-sufficient tribes. Keeping land at the forefront of both individual and societal success is an effective path forward because it is meaningful at every level - whether you just want to not hate the world, or you want to improve the living conditions of your community, or you want to build a new society. Even disregarding the bigger picture, this perspective is nothing but practical. How will you feed your family when industrial agriculture fails and supply chains fall apart? Growing food is a concrete way of solving a very real and imminent problem without depending on people who don't care about us or our planet. There's nothing glamorous about this, it's hands in the dirt kind of change, but it's real and it happens right before your eyes. </p><p>Growing food doesn't have to be hard, lots of vegetables even grow like weeds! Grass lawns were once a symbol of wealth, yet now they sit in front of even the most impoverished homes. This paradox was intentionally designed through generations of propaganda. For years I was utterly confused, why are some vegetables considered to grow too well and eradicated while right next door people go hungry? Is there an abundance of food or isn't there!? I will leave you to answer this yourself, but either way it certainly doesn't have to be this way. Only within the last few decades did we gain access to thousands of seeds from every corner of the earth. Consider how many generations of work went into finding, domesticating and improving these crops throughout human history! This is a privilege few could even dream of until now. As the world transforms into something entirely new, it has in the very same moment bestowed upon us the plants of salvation. And with them comes the power to create a landscape unlike any before in history. </p><p>This research is an attempt to prepare for the extinction and help communities build resilient food systems. Most people have land with poor soil and very little knowledge about growing food. Finding crops that can grow in this environment and provide real sustenance is therefore of the utmost importance. Ultimately all this may accomplish very little, but every day that a garden lives it serves the creatures within. </p><p>The list of plants below is only what I have been looking into or trying to grow myself, it is not meant to be anything beyond that. There are an endless number of food plants, but I mainly research those that are cultivated or those with qualities that make them good candidates for cultivation. I must also be able to get my hands on seeds, so that severely limits my options as well. The list will be expanded and updated as I grow more plants and learn new things.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Nevertheless, a new breed of explorers has arisen, those who are disenchanted with the bland products of the supermarkets, those who still feel the primordial urge to plant, those whose tastes are adventurous. There are those whose pocketbooks are thin who can benefit from green leaves easily grown at home. Finally, there are the few who recognize that the vegetables we emphasize now are but a part of a larger, and mostly still available heritage, a heritage whose potentials have still not been fully realized.</i></p><p><i>- Edible Leaves Of The Tropics </i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>The Plants We Eat</h2><p>How do we even begin to feed ourselves? What are we growing and eating? I personally do not grow nearly enough food to feed myself (nor do I have the land to). It is a difficult task that most people throughout most of history have not attempted. Even after the advent of agriculture, a significant portion of food was often foraged from the local environment. But the natural abundance that once covered the earth has been almost completely destroyed. As agriculture evolved to power an ever-expanding civilization, forests were felled and landscapes were permanently disfigured. We burned down ecosystems masterfully designed over millennia, teeming with life and full of nutritious food, in an attempt to grow something a fraction as productive in their place, all with big clumsy hands and little human brains. The plants that sprouted in these graveyards were not grown for people, but markets and masters; they could not nourish us in the same way. All this is only to say that growing all of our own food in a truly sustainable way requires a monumental effort and has not been the norm for any period of human history. But the old world is gone and it is never coming back, so we must do what we can given our circumstances. Growing only a portion of our food still has enormous benefits and can certainly create some sense of food security, even if it is not complete. So returning to our original question, what should we grow? What plants do people eat to survive? </p><p>The broadest pattern that emerges for practically any species on earth is that the foods that provide the most energy and nutrition (and are digestible by the specific anatomy of the creature) in any given landscape become primary sources of sustenance. That means a guerilla that has access to fruits will generally prioritize those over leaves. Eating 20 pounds of fruit is much easier than eating 20 pounds of leaves. And like many other mammals, humans gravitate towards high-density sources of energy like nuts, fruits, roots and seeds to sustain themselves. Leafy vegetables, while an essential addition to our diet, require a much larger quantity to provide the same amount of energy. </p><p>This happens to work out quite well for us because nuts and fruits are some of the easiest, most productive perennial crops. Even with a limited amount of space we have many options, including hazelnut, plum and mulberry. Once planted, they can often continue producing for decades - talk about a return on investment! Tree crops also require significantly less resources to produce, meaning they will often tolerate poorer soil and less frequent watering than many herbaceous crops. In this way they are extremely efficient at producing food. The benefits of trees are truly endless and there is no easier way to improve the health of a landscape. Fruit and nut trees are therefore the first priority for us and can make up a significant portion of our diet. </p><p>Root crops are also a very dense source of energy, often more so than fruit. They usually require more work, however, as soil may need to be built up and the crops must be regularly propagated, either by seed or division. Cold-hardy, perennial root crops usually need at least 2 years of growth before harvest. This includes plants like groundnut and doraji. However, some can be harvested every year like the super-productive sunchoke. While perennial roots are more work than simply picking fruit off a tree, they usually require very little maintenance once planted. Annual roots may require more work to grow, but can significantly expand our options with some heavy hitters like achira, taro or potato. Alongside nuts and fruits, roots are another significant addition to our diet. </p><p>Our next consideration is the smallest of the bunch: seeds. When people grow all their own food, seeds are usually how they do it. Seeds, including grains and pulses, are very calorically dense, can be eaten in quantity, and are easily stored or transported. This is why almost every civilization on earth has been built on them. But growing grains sustainably can be difficult - most often it results in a monoculture that degrades the soil while providing very little ecological value. And to top it all off, grains require the most labor of any food mentioned here to grow, harvest and process. This is not to say they should be avoided, only that how they are grown and incorporated into our diet needs to be reconsidered. Pulses can be a valuable addition for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil and help other crops grow. But even so, this category of foods is generally comprised of labor-intensive annuals that are difficult to incorporate into more permanent food systems. Ultimately it may be useful to think of seeds, grains, and pulses as another addition to a varied diet, and not necessarily the staple of every meal. </p><p>Finally, we arrive at leafy vegetables and the like. While they don't provide the bulk of our sustenance, they are necessary for vitamins and minerals (and flavor!). They also bring diversity and excitement to the garden. Here too we can focus on perennials that provide a crop every year with almost no effort after the initial planting. Plants like good king henry, turkish rocket and seombadi provide excellent perennial alternatives to some of the more common vegetables you may be used to eating. Succulents like prickly pear or dolnamul can turn barren land with very little fertility into an oasis of fresh food. Plants that generate a lot of biomass like udo can offer us regular harvests while producing lots of organic matter for mulching. Weedy annuals like perilla can compete with grass and turn unproductive land into a thicket of food in a single season. The options are truly limitless, and every plant has its own unique traits that can be utilized to our advantage.</p><p>The food we choose to grow is also fundamentally related to how we eat. If we only eat a few times per day, each meal needs to be extremely calorically dense, further deepening our reliance on grains. But what if we ate more like the guerilla? It's a lot easier to eat five pounds of fruit over the course of an entire day than it is to eat it at only three meals. Maybe changing what we eat also means changing how we eat.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Working With Nature</h2><p>The methods I use all fit into a singular holistic approach - working with natural systems to incorporate food crops into the landscape. The plants are our teachers. This mean learning from them without any preconceived notions about how they should grow or what they should be doing. We are watching and listening, not expecting. It is absolutely essential that we approach this with a sense of humility, respect, and the recognition that plants are complex and intelligent living beings. We will never understand the endless layers of nuance that guide their growth, but lucky for us we don't need to. All we need to do is listen closely and offer our service.</p><p>Healthy soil is the backbone of temperate food forests, and plants are natural soil builders. Plants build soil using a few primary methods. Sending roots into the soil adds organic matter, cycles nutrients, aerates the soil and gives it structure. This builds soil from within. After the plants die, their stems and leaves fall over and act as mulch until they fully decompose. Dead plants keep the soil from drying out, return nutrients to the topsoil and offer a sheltered microclimate for everything happening at ground level. This builds soil from above. And the way plants naturally die and return to the ground creates a thick but not overly dense layer of mulch. Most importantly, it has structure. It allows space for other seeds to germinate and grow while still offering shelter from the elements. When one plant dies it creates the right environment for the next plant to take its spot, to work the soil with its roots, and then to become mulch for the next plant. This is the genius of nature. </p><p>So our two most important methods of building soil are using the power of roots to work the soil, and returning organic matter back to the topsoil as mulch. In the garden we can imitate these patterns by letting plants cover as much ground as possible. The more roots we have working the soil for us, the better. Of course, we can't let every single plant grow to maturity or else there would be no room for our food crops. This is where we come in. We can curate which plants to let grow and which to cut down. Instead of ripping everything up and dumping an even mat of mulch on our beds, we can build the soil more naturally. By cutting down plants in the garden and using them as mulch, we are imitating a natural soil-building pattern.</p><p>Practically, implementing this system is fairly straightforward because we are letting nature do most of the work for us. There will be a host of plants growing in our garden beds whether we like or not. If any plants are competing too much with our food crops, we just cut them down and let them fall where they are. The more aggressive the species is the more often those plants will need to be removed. If we let them grow they may create too much shade or spread too aggressively. But the species that present little competition to our food crops need less management. Some of them may be edible themselves, some may attract beneficial insects, some may fix nitrogen, some may protect the soil. We are looking at the ground and seeing which plants are working for us and which ones aren't. Those that aren't get ripped up and now they are working for us as mulch! </p><p>As an example, in my garden beds I allow many plants to grow, some of which are: <i>Duchesnea indica [mock strawberry] </i>acts as a non-invasive groundcover;<i> Trifolium repens [white clover] </i>and any other leguminous plants fix nitrogen; <i>Lobelia inflata [Indian tobacco] </i>is a native medicinal; <i>Stellaria media [chickweed]</i> is a delicous edible; <i>Zinnia peruviana [Peruvian zinnia] </i>is a beautiful flower appreciated by local pollinators. There are also many that I rip up and mulch in place with as often as possible: <i>Muhlenbergia schreberi [nimblewill]</i> or any other weedy grasses spready quickly by rhizome and outcompete food crops; <i>Erechtites hieraciifolius [American burnweed], Acalypha rhomboidea [copperleaf], </i>and<i> Persicaria maculosa [lady's thumb] </i>all multiply rapidly by seed and can quickly take over garden beds. It is always helpful to watch how a plant interacts with the its environment before running to rip it up. Natural processes are constantly working towards a healthier ecosystem and are ultimately doing the vast majority of work for us. Our role is not to redefine these processes, but use them to help guide the environment towards productivity and diversity. </p><p>This system works particularly well for beds with annuals and biennials that rely on seed dispersal for their continued survival. A thick layer of mulch would lock in moisture but prevent the dispersed seeds from germinating. A thin layer of mulch would allow the seeds to germinate but dry the soil out. But mulching in place with native plants creates a structured mulch that is thick enough to lock in moisture but open and aerated enough for germinating seeds to grow. This system also allows us to work within a sustainable, closed loop. We are not depending on mulch or soil delivered from somewhere else, everything we need is being grown right on our own land. We are not importing fertility, we are building it.</p><p>Encouraging plants to cover the soil and continuously decompose has added benefits as well. First, it creates the right environment for insects. Bugs need a diverse landscape with a variety of physical niches to take advantage of. They don't like flat sheets of mulch. If we didn't have the right balance of insects, we would constantly be fighting against them. This method of management invites them all in to sort it out amongst themselves. The insects can then become our partners as primary decomposers of dead plants, continuously adding fertility to the soil. Second, it creates the right environment for beneficial fungal networks. Plants depend on fungi to survive and thrive. The more roots they can partner with and the more organic matter we can feed them, the better. </p><p>Moving beyond building soil, we can also imitate how plants naturally disperse seed. Direct seeding right into the ground is effective and produces high germination rates, but there are drawbacks. If all the seedlings germinate at roughly the same time, they are all subject to identical conditions during identical phases of growth. If a dry spell occurs right after germination and the seedlings are not drought tolerant enough, they will all die unless they are watered. Or a slug may come through and eat them. Or a bunny may walk on them. Or a heavy downpour may damage them. Or it may be too sunny and they'll get scorched. Any number of things could happen to affect them. Essentially, by forcing them to grow where you've put them and when you've decided to water them, the whole population is now entirely dependent on you. But when seeds are naturally dispersed through whatever mechanism the plant uses, they tend to grow in slightly different circumstances. Many will not germinate at all, some will sit on a leaf until being knocked over a few months later, some will get moved around by the birds. Some will germinate and die because of the weather or because they landed in the wrong niche. Only a small percentage of them will grow to maturity - this is natural, and this is why plants produce so many seeds (hundreds or thousands). But even though the rate of germination is much lower, the resiliency of that population is much higher. So whenever possible we are imitating the natural dispersal of seeds and encouraging them to germinate intermittently in different conditions. This can be as simple as letting seeds drop of their own accord, but for the best results it often means spreading them around the garden beds where we think they will grow well. Seeds can be left in their pods and dropped on top of other plants or mulch. Lucky for them I have legs! I can move their seeds around farther than they can, and I'm sure they would thank me for this if they could. For most annuals or biennials, the pattern is fairly similar: help the plant propagate itself without getting in the way. We are giving power back to the seeds by letting them decide when to germinate and how to grow - our job is only to create the right environment for them to do it. </p><p>For annuals or biennials this method requires a lot of seed. A single plant can produce thousands of seeds, but in any given season less than a dozen may grow to maturity (this will vary based on the plant and how favorable the local environment is). Unfortunately, most seed packets come with comparatively few seeds. So our first generation should be grown in more carefully managed conditions and cared for until they go to seed. This will get the plant acquainted with our local conditions while increasing our seed count to something more realistic. Once we have have hundreds or thousands of fresh seeds, these can then be dispersed more naturally into the garden beds and allowed to grow on their own. The soil is now functioning as our seed bank - every year we are depositing more and more seeds into it that will then wait for the right opportunity to germinate and grow. With every successive generation, the plants will be better acclimated to this specific method and will grow more easily. And as the amount of seeds in the soil increases, we can spend less time weeding because our food crops will be able to compete better and cover more ground. </p><p>We must remember that seeds and plants are intelligent, responsive living beings. They understand the particulars of every patch of soil. They understand the nuances of weather. In many ways they are much smarter than us. With my human eyes and hands I can only know so much about the soil. If one of us has to decide where and when to grow, it should be them. As a human I do, of course, have certain strengths: weeding, mulching, loosening and building soil, dispersing seed. My arms help create a favorable environment for the crops, and my legs help disperse their seed in the right spot. But I don't bother trying to control their growth because this is what they are good at and I would only be getting in their way! It is a beautiful thing to partner with a plant. Honor that relationship and only good things can come. </p><p>Even with all the help we provide, some plants will simply not be suited for our soil or climate without a lot of work. So it's just as important to find the right species for our specific conditions. We can't expect to drop any old plant in and have it grow! This is why our plant selection prioritizes resiliency, and those that do survive become become stronger with every generation. Before long the food will be growing itself. Of course, regular maintenance is unavoidable. In order to grow certain plants we must halt the process of succession - otherwise our garden would quickly become a deciduous forest (at least where I live). Incorporating tree crops helps us work with succession to a certain degree, but ultimately there is no way to avoid the basic work of weeding, transplanting and dispersing seeds. Every garden requires maintenance, but this method allows us to use natural processes to our advantage and intervene only when it is meaningful. This is not a step by step plan with a full proof outcome. This is a dance.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Methods</h2><p>The methods we use to grow, maintain, harvest and propagate crops can make all the difference in both the health of the ecosystem and how much work it requires to maintain. These are the basic principles I use in my garden.</p><p><br></p><ol><li><b>Feed the soil. </b>Focus on crops that feed the soil. Plants like <i>Aralia cordata [udo]</i> and <i>Canna edulis [achira]</i> generate large amounts of top growth for mulching. Plants like <i>Raphanus sativus [radish]</i> and <i>Brassica rapa [turnip]</i> have fat roots that aerate the soil and feed beneficial bacteria when they decay. Plants like <i>Elaeagnus multiflora [goumi]</i> and <i>Phaseolus coccineus [runner bean]</i> fix nitrogen in the soil and keep it productive. </li><li><b>Build structure.</b> Loose soil gets compacted and washed away with heavy rains. Healthy soil has structure that improves drainage, aeration and water retention, all while holding it together and preventing erosion. Roots build structure within the soil, while mulching in place builds structure above the soil. Tilling is avoided because it destroys soil structure and the fungal networks that depend on it. </li><li><b>Weed selectively.</b> Native plants growing in our beds can serve important functions. Many are edible themselves, help protect the soil, fix nitrogen or attract beneficial insects. Any plants that offer little function or compete with our food crops are ripped up and mulched in place.</li><li><b>Disperse seeds naturally.</b> Seeds should be dispersed on top of mulch and in their pods if they have any. Naturally dispersed seeds land in slightly different niches and germinate intermittently. This improves the resiliency of the population in the face of unpredictable weather patterns and pressure from disease or insects. This also allows the soil to function as our seed bank, holding large quantities of seed until they are ready to grow. </li><li><b>Annuals alongside perennials. </b>Perennials offer stability and reliable production. These can be transplanted, a small amount of work for many years of food. Annuals have a different niche altogether and should be treated as such. They love taking advantage of disturbed soil and quickly filling in empty spaces between our perennials. Their seeds should be dispersed across the garden beds so they can spring into action when an opportunity presents itself.</li><li><b>Roots alongside roots. </b>Roots are an important source of energy, but many require deep soil disturbance to harvest. These should be primarily grown alongside other complementary root crops. This makes harvesting easier, ensures we don't damage nearby perennials, and limits the impact on soil structure. </li><li><b>Harvesting is selecting.</b> Harvesting the weakest plants allows the population to become stronger and better adapted to our local conditions with every generation. Our first priority is not a big harvest, but plants with resilient and productive genetics.</li><li><b>Use local materials.</b> Most gardeners have access to natural materials like branches, leaves or grass clippings from adjacent land or the local community. A thick layer of leaves can be great for beds with primarily root crops or perennials. In beds where seed germination is a priority, I prefer grass clippings and small branches.</li><li><b>Collect rain water. </b>Harvest as much rainwater as possible to reduce reliance on unsustainable sources of water. If plants can't be grown with locally available water, you might want to think twice about growing them at all. If you already have a gutter system, all you need to do is a purchase a few parts <a href="https://www.rainbrothers.com/store/DIY-Rain-Barrel-Kit-c73647286" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> and hook them up to a large barrel (or trash can). The system is easy to expand as well.</li></ol><p> </p><p>The methods I use won't give you beds full of vegetables right away, and at first it may feel like nothing is working. This is totally normal! No amount of upfront work will change the fact that it takes time and persistence to learn how to care for plants. The first few years are always the hardest, but as time goes on it will get so much easier and so much more productive. If you trust the soil-building techniques and continue offering your service to the multitude of creatures that reside in your garden, then it is inevitable you will see improvements. I spend a lot of time on this stuff and still kill so many plants. Things are going wrong more often than not! Haha. Be patient.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Grass → Garden</h2><p>This is a rough and generalized process for converting areas overtaken by native grasses and plants into usable garden beds. This is not meant to be used for larger areas or fields - these usually need to be cleared and reseeded with the right equipment, or slowly transformed over a much longer period of time. </p><p><br></p><ul><li>Identify area to be converted, mark edges.</li><li><ul><li class="ql-indent-1">Beds should be narrow enough to easily manage without stepping in.</li></ul></li><li>Clear existing vegetation.</li><li><ul><li class="ql-indent-1">Mow or cut down the vegetation.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Use a shovel to remove the top layer of roots.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Shake out excess dirt from roots onto bed, place the rest in compost.</li></ul></li><li>Alternatively, smother the vegetation with cardboard or mulch.</li><li><ul><li class="ql-indent-1">Use cardboard, tarp or a thick layer of mulch.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Remove after existing vegetation is dead.</li></ul></li><li>Loosen the soil throughout the bed with a pitchfork.</li><li><ul><li class="ql-indent-1">Sink the pitchfork as deeply as possible every few inches, gently pulling back to slightly lift soil.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">This will reduce compaction without disturbing the soil's natural layers.</li></ul></li><li>Disperse cover crop to protect and revitalize soil.</li><li><ul><li class="ql-indent-1">A blend of perennial clover, radish and turnip works well.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Kenaf or amaranth can be seeded in spring to generate mulch.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Incorporate useful seeds from other parts of the garden if available. </li><li class="ql-indent-1">Cover seeded soil with grass clippings if available and water thoroughly.</li></ul></li><li>Maintain bed to support seeded crops.</li><li><ul><li class="ql-indent-1">Mulch in place with any competitive weeds.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Water regularly if soil begins to dry out.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">Allow radish and turnip to set seed and decompose in soil.</li></ul></li><li>Your garden bed now has a strong foundation!</li><li><ul><li class="ql-indent-1">Continue building bed with transplants and seeds.</li><li class="ql-indent-1">See my favorite crops and polycultures below for some ideas.</li></ul></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Even if working in larger areas, this method can be used to create small 'islands' within the existing vegetation that are regularly maintained and expanded. But if grasses or other native plants are not removed in any way, different methods are needed. Slowly transforming the space by transplanting larger perennials, especially trees and shrubs, is your best bet. I am also experimenting with crops like kenaf and barley that can be direct seeded into compacted soil and succeed even with heavy competition from grasses.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>What would it mean for us to come to terms with the knowledge that civilization, our whole mode of development and culture, has been premised and built upon extermination—on a history experienced as "terror without end" (to borrow a phrase from Adorno)?

This is based on a few different criteria: how easy they are to grow and use, their nutritional and medicinal qualities, their ability to regenerate soil, and how productive they are. Numbered in order of preference.</p><p><br></p><h3>Vegetables</h3><ol><li><b>Aralia Cordata 'Udo' (Perennial):</b> Edible young leaves and stem on a productive die-back bush.</li><li><b>Dystaenia Takesimana 'Seombadi' (Perennial):</b> Stalks and leaves provide an excellent alternative to celery.</li><li><b>Chenopodium Bonus-Henricus 'Good King Henry' (Perennial): </b>Choice flower heads and spinach-like leaves.</li><li><b>Bunias Orientalis 'Turkish Rocket' (Perennial):</b> A perennial mustard, flowers every year and eaten like rapini.</li><li><b>Brassica Rapa Rapa 'Turnip' (Annual):</b> Delicious leaves and flowerheads with a root that feeds the soil.</li><li><b>Opuntia Humifosa 'Prickly Pear' (Perennial):</b> Cold hardy cactus for poor soil, both pads and fruit can be eaten.</li><li><b>Perilla Frutescens 'Perilla' (Annual): </b>Green varieties are used as a vegetable and can be grown in quantity.</li><li><b>Sedum Sarmentosum 'Dolnamul' (Perennial):</b> A fast-growing, edible sedum that forms a beautiful carpet.</li></ol><h3><br></h3><h3>Onions</h3><ol><li><b>Allium Cepa Proliferum 'Walking Onion' (Perennial):</b> One of the easiest onions to grow and very versatile. </li><li><b>Allium Hookeri 'Hooker's Onion' (Perennial):</b> Another easy onion with delicious leaves.</li></ol><p><br></p><h3>Roots</h3><ol><li><b>Helianthus Tuberosus 'Sunchoke' (Perennial):</b> Grows anywhere in sun and produces heavily.</li><li><b>Canna Edulis 'Achira' (Annual): </b>Peruvian root crop with large tropical leaves and sweet rhizomes.</li><li><b>Colocasia Esculenta 'Taro' (Annual)</b>: Some varieties mature in under 6 months, producing small cormels.</li><li><b>Tropaeolum Tuberosum 'Mashua' (Annual):</b> Another Andean root crop forming tubers in short days of fall.</li><li><b>Platycodon Grandiflorus 'Doraji' (Perennial): </b>Korean root crop, growing larger every year until harvest. </li><li><b>Solanum Ajanhuiri 'Potato' (Annual): </b>A potato species from Peru known for its frost resistance. </li><li><b>Apios Americana 'Groundnut' (Perennial):</b> A native with small, protein rich tubers.</li></ol><h3><br></h3><h3>Seeds</h3><ol><li><b>Amaranthus Caudatus 'Amaranth' (Annual):</b> One of the easiest and most productive grains.</li><li><b>Phaseolus Coccineus 'Runner Bean' (Annual):</b> A reliable and versatile nitrogen-fixing vine. </li></ol><p><br></p><h3>Fruit/Trees</h3><ol><li><b>Corylus Americana 'American Hazelnut' (Perennial):</b> A native nut tree small enough for the backyard.</li><li><b>Prunus Americana 'Plum' (Perennial):</b> Native, easy to grow and loaded with plums.</li><li><b>Elaeagnus Multiflora 'Goumi' (Perennial):</b> A great support tree that fixes nitrogen with edible berries.</li><li><b>Actinidia Arguta 'Hardy Kiwi' (Perennial): </b>The vigorous and hardy cousin to the kiwi with small, hairless fruit.</li><li><b>Ficus Carica 'Fig' (Perennial): </b>Will grow anywhere there is sun and very simply to propagate.</li><li><b>Morus Nigra 'Mulberry' (Perennial):</b> Dwarf varieties are perfect for smaller spaces, berries produced in quantity.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>If I were starting a garden from scratch, these are the crops I would focus on. Get some trees going early as they will often take years to bear fruit. Plums, figs and mulberries all grow very easily. Goumi will help support them by fixing nitrogen. Dedicate some beds for regular soil disturbance to grow roots, an important source of energy. Start with sunchoke and achira, both easy and very productive. Learn to grow perennial vegetables by starting them from seed in pots. Seombadi, good king henry, and turkish rocket are all wonderful choices. Grow at least a few of each and transplant them to beds that will get little soil disturbance. Purchase some perennial onion bulbs like walking onion or hooker's onion, plant them alongside your perennial vegetables, and divide them at the end of every year. Direct seed some turnips and radishes and then disperse the seed they produce across your perennial beds. Building a garden is work, but the magic is that it gets easier and more productive over time.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Polycultures</h2><p>The following are experimental group plantings I am testing. I find polycultures most useful for root crops as they often require regular or deep soil disturbance and replanting, whereas many other vegetables and herbs can often grow alongside each other without much trouble.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><b>Annual Roots, Large | Achira + Taro + Mashua:</b> This is a prime time polyculture with three of the most productive root crops. I use it in the best spot in the garden that stays moist year round and gets lots of sun. The achira gets tall enough to provide some shade and shelter for the others, while the mashua is allowed to sprawl on the ground and climb around. Harvest when they've all died back, and either replant immediately with a thick layer of mulch or bring indoors to overwinter if necessary. Produces a lot of mulch that can be applied back to the same spot once harvested. Moist and rich soil, sun.</li><li><b>Annual Roots, Small | Potato + Oca + Walking Onion: </b>Designed for low-till cultivation in which the potato and oca are harvested and replanted all at once in the fall. The potatoes die back well before the first frost and wait in the ground until the oca dies back. Onion tops can be harvested as needed and the whole plant is divided when the bed is dug up. Bunching onions also work. Nasturtium can also be incorporated to clamber around as it only picks up speed once the potatoes die back. Moderate and loose soil, sun.</li><li><b>Perennial Roots, Competetive | Sunchoke + Chinese Yam + Chinese Bugleweed: </b>Sunchoke is the heavy-yielding star of this show and the trellis for the chinese yam. Chinese bugelweed fills in the gaps around them. The yam should be planted in buried drainage pipes in between the sunchoke. This allows us to harvest the sunchoke every year without disturbing the yam, and makes harvesting the yam every 2nd or 3rd year much easier. Moderate soil, sun.</li><li><b>Perennial Roots, 2-3 Year Harvest | Doraji + Marshmallow + Groundnut: </b>Both doraji and marshmallow are easily grown taproots, the latter growing much taller. Works best when the marhsmallow is planted from a large division so it grows tall enough the first year to support the nitrogen-fixing groundnut. Other perennial roots like ladybell, deodeok or salsify can be incorporated as well. All harvested every 2nd or 3rd year and divisions are replanted. Moderate soil, shade to sun.</li><li><b>Annual Vegetables, Competetive | Kenaf + Perilla:</b> Perilla usually forms dense patches and shades out other plants, but kenaf grows so strong and tall it can shoot right through it. Perilla is also tolerant of the shade kenaf creates. Both can grow in poor soil and help regenerate unproductive land. Leave of both are harvested as needed, and the kenaf stalks can be harvested when the plant dies. Perilla will reseed itself if you let it but kenaf should be direct seeded. Poor or compacted soil, sun.</li><li><b>Perennial Vegetables, Drought Tolerant | Prickly Pear + Dolnamul:</b> A basic pairing, both vegetables thriving in similar conditions, dolanmul acting as a groundcover for prickly pear. The only issue is that prickly pear has glochids, so I would avoid harvesting the dolnamul directly next to the cactus pads just in case they got knocked off. You do not want to eat a glochid! Poor or well-draining soil, sun.</li><li><b>Annual Seeds, Field | Amaranth + Runner Bean:</b> A straightforward choice for seed production. The amaranth should be transplanted and the runner bean should be direct seeded right next to it at the same time. This will give the amaranth a head start so it is tall enough to support the nitrogen-fixing beans. A method originally presented by Will Bonsall. Moderate soil, sun.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Crops propagated by their root like achira, taro, mashua, potato and sunchoke should ideally have multiple varieties, and every season they should be rotated within the beds so each variety is growing in a different spot. Crops that can be propagated by either division or seed, like marshmallow and doraji, can be divided but should regularly be grown from seed as well to maintain genetic diversity.</p><p>These polycultures are not self-sustaining and should be regularly fed/mulched, especially if they are growing in the same bed from year to year. Japanese mugwort is an easy plant to use for mulch. Beans or clover can be incorporated for nitrogen. Depending on the local environment, plants that draw pollinators may also be helpful to control pests. Think of these polycultures as building blocks that interact with and depend on the diversity of the rest of the garden. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Energy</h2><p>If our goal is to grow enough food to make a dent in our diet, it can be helpful to consider where our energy is coming from. Calories may not be the best symbol of how our food sustains us, but it's a useful way to compare crops. </p><p>The tables below include selected crops with available nutritional information, a rough estimate of their caloric value, and possible yields per plants based on decent growing conditions in my climate. I like to think about energy per plant because that is how I tend to break things down in my head, but this does not take into account time or space. For example, achira is harvested at the end of the growing season and takes up more space, but potatoes can usually be harvested after only a few months and take up comparitively little space.</p><p><br></p><h3>Roots</h3><table tableid="1e57db51" columns="4" style="--columns: 4; --rows: 8;" rows="8" class=""><tr><td class=""><b>Crop</b></td><td class=""><b>Calories/Pound</b></td><td class=""><b>Pounds/Plant</b></td><td class=""><b>Calories/Plant</b></td></tr><tr><td class="">Achira</td><td class="">370</td><td class="">6</td><td class="">2220</td></tr><tr><td class="">Sunchoke</td><td class="">330</td><td class="">5</td><td class="">1650</td></tr><tr><td class="">Mashua</td><td class="">310</td><td class="">4</td><td class="">1240</td></tr><tr><td class="">Taro</td><td class="">500</td><td class="">2</td><td class="">1000</td></tr><tr><td class="">Potato</td><td class="">350</td><td class="">2</td><td class="">700</td></tr><tr><td class="">Oca</td><td class="">330</td><td class="">1</td><td class="">330</td></tr><tr><td class="">Burdock</td><td class="">400</td><td class="">0.5</td><td class="">200</td></tr></table><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Man, do not pride yourself on your superiority to the animals, for they are without sin, while you, with all your greatness, you defile the earth wherever you appear and leave an ignoble trail behind you -- and that is true, alas, for almost every one of us!</i></p><p><i>-Fyodor Dostoyevsky</i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Guide</h2><p><b>Annual/Perennial: </b>Designations for zone 7, may differ in other climates. I typically try to use the most common English name for the plant, although the Latin name is always the most accurate. I also sometimes include the name of the plant in the most relevant language to help with personal research.</p><p><b>Edible:</b> Useful edible parts. Not comprehensive, not a reference, only a starting point. Often there will be more edible portions than indicated, but I may not mention them for any number of reasons. Do not eat anything you are not 100% familiar with. Always be certain of your identification and the parts edible. Consult multiple sources, see resources at the end of page. </p><p>I do not always indicate whether a plant can be eaten raw or must be cooked. Some plants cannot be eaten raw but can be cooked or prepared in some other way, such as drying or fermenting. Processes like fermenting will sometimes render a food safe to eat in the same way that cooking would. But it is not always this simple. Many plants must be prepared in a very specific way in order to make them safe to eat. <i>Petasites Japonicus</i>, for example, should always be both blanched and peeled prior to eating. Or consider <i>Rheum Acuminatum</i>, a little-known species of rhubarb. It is usually dried and pickled before being eaten. Does this mean it cannot just be cooked like other species of rhubarb? It may be totally harmless, or maybe the drying and fermenting accomplishes something that cooking does not, something we are not aware of. Tradition is wise, but it rarely explains itself. And even if it was harmful, the effects are unlikely to be obvious. Some plants can quietly build up toxins in your body for decades before manifesting themselves as symptoms of an illness. So just because a plant can be eaten without any noticeable adverse effects does not mean that it is safe to eat regularly over a longer period of time. This is why it is important to understand the history of how foods are prepared and eaten. After that, if you want to experiment then the risk is yours to take. But as far as this reference goes, I try to stay conservative. </p><p><u>Root:</u> Plants that store energy in roots or tubers usually draw on this energy to produce flowering shoots. Perennial roots are therefore usually harvested after the plant has flowered and been given ample time to store more energy in the roots. This may be at the end of the growing season or it may be earlier. Annual roots are harvested before flowering as in this case it signifies the end of the plant's life. This is often at the end of spring or fall depending on when it was planted and the lifespan of the plant, but may be any time of year. After flowering occurs the root will be tough and inedible. However, whether annual or perennial the best practices for harvesting will depend on the specific plant and growing conditions.</p><p><u>Shoot:</u> Shoot refers only to the young growth of the plant when it first emerges from the ground; in other words, the entire aerial portion of the young plant, often in spring. This is <i>not</i> the same as terminal or tender new growth (see below). How large the young plant is when harvested depends on the specific plant. Just because a shoot is edible does not indicate that any part of the mature plants is edible. If a plant contains harmful or toxic substances, these may be in low enough quantities when the plant is young but not when it matures. If the mature leaves of a plant are edible then usually so is the shoot, but depending on the plant I may not write this if it is not normally eaten that way (as in the case with many herbs). Shoots are valued for their sweet flavor and tender texture, especially when the mature plant may be bitter or tough. They are therefore often the preferred harvest of a plant.</p><p><u>Stem &amp; Leaf:</u> If the leaf is edible then usually so is the terminal or tender new growth, harvested with some of the new stem. In fact, when the leaves are small, young or tightly bunched, this can often be the best time to harvest. I only indicate separately that the stem is edible when it constitutes a meaningful portion of the edible harvest or when it can be eaten even when relatively mature. For example, amaranth or nettle are often eaten with some of the tender stem, but I only write the leaf is edible because the stem is relatively insignificant to the harvest. However, when water spinach, angelica, udo and many others are harvested, the stem is cut further down and constitutes a significant part of the vegetable, therefore it is included in the edible portions. Of course this is not always a clear line as it varies between plants and how you choose to harvest or prepare them.</p><p><u>Inflorescence + Flower:</u> Flowering shoots are a separate identification and are indicated as inflorescence. These are eaten when still young, clustered, and tender. If the inflorescence is edible then often so are the flower buds and flowers, although this may not always be practical or palatable. There are roughly three stages for harvest: entire young inflorescence while still tender, sometimes with some of the tender stem attached; the individual, unopened flower buds picked off once the flowering stem becomes tougher; the blooming flowers when fully or partially open. Some plants are only eaten during one stage, while some can be eaten during all three. Once a plant begins to form a flowering shoot, the leaves usually become more bitter and tough as energy is being drawn away to support the flowers. </p><p><u>Seed:</u> I will occasionally indicate the seed is edible if it is useful in some way. Just because a flower is edible does not mean the seed is, and vice versa.</p><p>Some of the plants are marked as calorie crops. This is to indicate they are efficient producers of calories given one season and a limited amount of space. This is entirely root and seed crops. It does not include many other useful and potential staple crops that take longer to grow or are not as efficient.</p><p>The best way to know how to eat a plant is to do research, grow it and become familiar with it. Even with references, the actual details of how it's harvested and eaten can vary between plants. And keep in mind that many online references are just summarizing (often poorly or incorrectly) physical reference books that provide more detail. If a plant is uncommon, then especially thorough research is required. Always remember the golden rule: if it's not regularly eaten, don't eat it regularly. Typically we are looking to answer a few basic questions. Is there an extensive history of humans eating this part of the plant? If so, how is it prepared and in what quantity is it eaten? Are there any indications that this plant may contain harmful or toxic substances? The more information you have, the better.<i>  </i></p><p>Just because one species in a genus is edible does not mean that other species are. And just because one part of the plant is edible does not mean that others parts are. These kinds of assumptions will put you in the hospital or in the ground. There are even cases, as with some members of the <i>Calystegia </i>genus, where one variety of a species is edible but another variety within the very same species is not. Therefore we must be thoughtful about what exactly we are eating and recognize that academic taxonomy has its limits. Even if an online resource says something is edible (including this one), you must do your own research!</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Useful methods of propagation. Usually seed, stem cutting, or rhizome/tuber/root division. Seeds that prefer cold stratification or sunlight to germinate are often noted as such. I usually try to get bare roots or potted plants if a seed is difficult to germinate.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Rough guidelines for minimum sun requirements: Sun (≈90-100%) → Part Shade (≈60-90%) → Shade (≈30-60%) → Deep shade (≈0-30%). Estimating sun is difficult, but I do my best to give rough guidelines. Most of the time, if a plant prefers shade, it will also prefer rich and moist soil. And keep in mind that just because a plants prefers sun doesn't mean it can handle the heat summer usually brings. This is often true for plants that grow naturally in cooler climates, such as in high altitudes or in coastal areas. Some plants have markers that indicate they grow easily or self-sow, these are great plants to start with.</p><p><b>Wildlife:</b> Impact of wildlife and insects on plant. We have lots of deer as well as chipmunks, rabbits and birds that live nearby. I try to grow enough food for everyone, but I can't let them eat everything! I have some fenced areas for sensitive plants I don't want being bothered. I try to be as hands-off as possible and rarely remove insects from plants or interfere with their growth. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Everything else. Observations about growth habits, useful varieties, hardiness, harvesting, interactions with other plants and more. Plants with photos were grown in Maryland, roughly zone 7a. You may notice some of the plants in my photos don't look perfectly healthy - this is okay. If it is a perennial, as long as it has a healthy root system it will grow just fine after being planted and given a few seasons to adjust. The conditions are fairly wet year round, although in the summer there are stretches where the soil dries out. Soil is good overall, some spots with heavy clay and some very sandy. Normally the only time I water plants is while they are getting established. Most non-perennial plants survive (or die) exclusively on rain water, unless they are lucky enough to be near a perennial I'm watering.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Herbs</h2><p><br></p><h3>Agastache Rugosa 'Korean Mint' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.

A Japanese reference book I have also says it is not eaten. Another says only the roots are of any value.</p><p>Of course, there is no obvious resolution. All or some of the plant may have a compound that makes it unsafe for regular consumption. Certain methods of preparation may make it safer for eating (like fuki or ferns). It is also possible that some forms are safer than others, as there are at least a few different varieties. Ultimately, I would avoid it unless you are already very familiar with it.

Of these I tend to focus on kale because this particular variety of kale is known to have some perennial forms. Most kale will set seed after their first winter, but some forms will either set seed after 2-3 years of growth or never/rarely set seed at all. Those that don't set seed are usually propagated by stem cutting. Stem cuttings can be placed in moist soil to root and clone the original plant.</p><p>I am particularly interested in the forms that can live for a few years before setting seed. This not only ensures genetic diversity but also opens up the possibility of harvesting the inflorescence and perhaps breeding some form of a short-lived perennial kale/broccoli vegetable.</p><p>Of the flowering forms I have noticed that some are able to continue growing, albeit in a very stunted way, even after flowering and without being pruned. This makes me wonder about the potential for a polycarpic perennial kale (flowering more than once). So I do see a lot of potential in these weird forms as well.</p><p>Most of the plants also generate a lot of seed, so in my garden I generally toss the pods around the beds, see what comes up, see how many of them flower after the first winter, see how many of those are able to continue growing, keep track of the specimens that appear to be perennial, and just generally try to select for interesting specimens as they come up. </p><p>Like others in this genus it is very susceptible to insects.

Within this species I tend to focus on turnips (see that listing in the roots section), but I do grow some other varieties just for the leaves. </p><p>I particularly like curled-leaf mustard as it is incredibly cold hardy and grows through snow just fine. This variety also prefers to germinate in very cold weather. Whereas turnips or other Brassicas are growing most of the year, curled-leaf mustard mostly shows up during winter. I appreciate this quality for two reasons. The first is that the more food I can have growing over winter, the better. The second is that I can have a hundred seeds for this variety sitting in my beds and they won't be competing during the growing season when I have tons of other stuff I'd like to grow. Instead the seeds just wait until the right temperature comes, when most other plants have already died off. Incorporating these 'timed-release' sort of seeds into my annual beds improves diversity with limited increase in competition. The only drawback is how pungent this variety is, so it is probably better cooked if eating in any quantity. </p><p><b>Photos:</b> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/v5bc28al1kpn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">B.

The main stem even gets woody after just one growing season. Unfortunately it will not survive outdoors in my climate, but there is potential to grow it in a greenhouse or to bring it indoors over winter. I tried bringing a few indoors for winter but after cleaning and trimming they did not survive, perhaps I brought them in too late. Even so this is still a fun plant to grow. If growing as a perennial the yields are better as the plant gets older. If growing as an annual, start it indoors as early as possible so the fruits have enough time to ripen before frost. They take their time with this so you have to be prepared. The fruits are relatively large and the seeds are black, unlike other peppers.</p><p><b>C. flexuosum</b> is another species that fascinates me, mostly because it is the hardiest species within the genus.

The flower head and bracts of cardoon can still be eaten but they are not as fleshy and so offer a less worthwhile harvest. The main harvest from cardoon is the thick leaf stalks.</p><p>Theoretically, cardoon should be an obvious selection for any garden where it will grow. The plant does not need great soil and can grow in sun or part shade. It effectively blocks out nearby competition with its large leaves and creates a significant amount of biomass for mulching. Mature plants produce a sizeable harvest as well. The only catch is that the leaf stalks can be quite unpalatable straight off the plant. This is why they are usually blanched by wrapping some sort of paper or cloth around the leaves. And even then they must be thoroughly boiled. So a wonderful vegetable to grow but may be a hassle to prepare. </p><p>Some varieties of cardoon have spines, but I would avoid these and instead opt for those without.

That being said the seed germination is quite good when tossed over disturbed soil. There are two main types available - one with smaller, serrated leaves and another with larger, more tender leaves. </p><p><i>Useful Plants Of Japan, Described And Illustrated </i>indicates this plant was sown in the fall and overwintered. In my climate it does not overwinter, however. When eaten as a vegetable it is cooked. <i>A Dictionary Of Japanese Food</i> writes that the raw leaves and small flowers are used as a garnish. <b>C. nankingense</b> is cultivated in China and eaten the same way. </p><p><b>C. morifolium </b>is a perennial alternative, most varieties are cultivated for ornamental purposed but some are edible.<b> </b>I would recommend against eating random varieties - stick to those cultivated for food or medicine. <a href="https://strictlymedicinalseeds.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Strictly Medicinal</a> has standard varieties good for eating.

And it's not like dandelion or some other weeds because this is one you actually want to eat and one that is cultivated as a vegetable in China. The flowers are some of the best out there being sweet and delicious, even when raw. </p><p>The flowers can be eaten as buds or fully opened. They are cooked, dried, pickled or sometimes eaten raw. The shoots are also eaten as a vegetable, but the leaves quickly get tough if left to grow. The roots are less commonly eaten. Most online resources indicate any species is fine to eat, whether its the flowers, shoots or roots. But not every species has a recorded history of being eaten, and those that do often do not include all three parts of the plant.</p><p>It seems the roots in particular are seldom or never eaten depending on the species.<i> Edible Wild Plants Of Vietnam</i> indicates at least one species used for edible flowers has mildly poisonous roots. Granted this book isn't the most reliable but it's worth noting. <i>The Encyclopedia Of Edible Plants Of North America </i>mentions the roots of some species are eaten<i> </i>but <i>Food Plants Of</i> <i>China</i> makes no mention of it for any of the species it lists. Both<i> Plants For Human Consumption</i> and <i>Cornucopia </i>only list some of the species as having an edible root. Many are listed as being eaten only for the shoots and flowers. Let us remember one of our basic principles - just because one species in a genus is edible in a certain way does not mean others are! </p><p>My recommendation is to stick to the species with a history of being eaten and not to bother with the roots. Along with this yellow flowering species eaten in Japan, this includes <b>H. fulva </b>(common orange ditch lily)<b> </b>and <b>H. lilioasphodelus/H. flava </b>(shorter plant with sweet-scented, yellow flowers).</p><p>Daylilies will grow in most soils and do fine in fairly deep shade. The common orange ditch lily is an aggressive spreader so put it in a spot that's easy to manage. Overall, they are an excellent perennial vegetable very well suited for food forest projects.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/q64e7778a2vs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hemerocallis spp.</a></p><p><br></p><h3><b>Hosta Mo</b>ntana 'Hosta' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>The situation for hostas is similar to that of daylilies - there is an extensive history of some species being eaten, and the rest are often assumed to be just as safe. I would suggest sticking with the well-documented species or doing your own research for the specific species you are interested in. This species is a standard in Japan and the normal reccomendation. </p><p>It is primarily the shoots, young leaves and petioles that are eaten. Most English sources do not mention the petioles but they appear in Japanese reference books more frequently. They are a good way to extend the harvest of the plant once the leaves become too big and tough. The flowers are sometimes a very minor crop as well, however <i>Food Plants Of China </i>indicates the flowers of <b>H. plantaginea</b> require cooking to detoxify them. Therefore do not assume they are safe raw for any species without evidence to the contrary (despite what you may read online). </p><p>The fact that hostas can tolerate full sun or deep shade makes them very fun to have in the garden. I can have other plants growing right next to them and they don't mind the shade it creates at all. They can act as a sort of groundcover in that way and still provide a high quality vegetable.</p><p>Will tolerate most conditions as long as the soil is not overly dry. Useful for deep shade where edible options are limited. Although the deer love it, there shouldn't be a problem harvesting the shoots as they typically only eat it later on in the growth cycle. That being said, if a small plant is continually eaten to the ground then it may simply die. Another excellent perennial vegetable for food forests. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/qtrlaudv6in9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hosta spp.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Ipomoea Aquatica 'Water Spinach' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Wet soil. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>In the same genus as sweet potato and morning glory (with similarly beautiful flowers). Common vegetable in southeast Asia, normally grown in more tropical climates but seems to have potential for growing and reseeding itself in temperate climates. Good potential because it can be eaten in quantity and spreads quickly by rhizome, which is a relatively unusual quality. But grown as an annual in this climate you'll need to plant at least a few to get enough of a harvest to make it worthwhile. Wait until the nights start to warm up to plant. </p><p>The difficulty with this plant is that it prefers a wet and sunny spot - not an easy combination in many temperate climates. Interesting companion planting possibilities. In my climate the first flowers appear in late August and by October the plant will have new flowers almost every day. Theoretically there should be plenty of time for it to produce seed. Most of the flowers don't seem to form seed pods, I'm not sure why. One plant had about a dozen seed pods, and it seems they barely have enough time to ripen, let alone dry out on the plant. There are narrow-leaf and broad-leaf forms (what I have), I don't know how they are different beyond shape though.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/di6rq952einf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">I. aquatica.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Levisticum Officinale 'Lovage' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b></p><p><b>Photos: </b></p><p><br></p><h3>Ligularia Fischeri 'Gomchwi' '곰취' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.

This variety is wonderful and a standard. A bit tougher than other varieties but makes up for it in how well it grows. This variety also sometimes 'catches' the flowers that fall off on the leaves below - these can be collected and used as a garnish. Green Ao is a nice Japanese variety, a bit softer and better for eating raw, but not nearly as vigorous. This one flowers and dies earlier too.</p><p>This species can get surprisingly large and bushy to the point that it can easily shade out other plants. Having it in the garden beds makes this a concern, so I prefer growing them out of the way where they can be given their own space. It is easy to imagine filling large areas with this plant in just a season or two. Big specimens will also produce a surprisingly thick and woody stem. This sort of carbon generation combined with its vigorous growth and ability to shade out weeds makes me think it could have a place in soil regeneration. As long as it can be controlled and easily removed for succession.</p><p>Some sources claim these plants need consistently moist soil - this is not true. They have proven very tolerant of dry soil.

I planted the 'Jewels' heirloom variety which I have been liking. <b>T. nanum</b> is very similar, some others.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/cv6l2mu19u0c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">T. majus.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Urtica Dioica 'Stinging Nettle' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division., stem, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. May grow well in meadows.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Tender new growth eaten. A highly nutritious, tasty and easy to grow plant - the only problem is that most varieties have stinging hairs that can be painful. Fortunately there exists a subspecies 'Galeopsifolia' that has little to none of that whatsoever! I have a mostly non-stinging variety that grew randomly in the garden, although I am not fully certain of the identification just yet. The main stem and leaves still have hairs but they are soft and relatively harmless. Towards the bottom of a more mature plant, the hairs become more rigid and pointy, but still I can touch them just fine and they are barely an inconvenience. It still seems to sting when I rub the back of my hand against certain parts of it, but even then it is very mild and goes away quickly. Not at all like the reports I've seen online. I also wonder if seed-grown plants could be selected for non-stinging qualities. Worth more research.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/tqsb29pqlr3r" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U. dioica.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Zingiber Mioga 'Myoga Ginger' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to part shade. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">EASY &amp; VIGOROUS</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established + Z. kawagoii.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>In the same genus as common ginger, but this species is the hardiest (Z6) and the main crop is the shoots and flower buds.

Slow from bulbet.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant. Some pests.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Easy to propagate via bulbs. You can plant the aerial bulbets, although they will take longer to produce a good crop and easily get lost in the garden. Varieties originally collected growing in the wild may have interesting qualities. Scapes and leaves make for good vegetables as well. Garlic only grows well and forms good bulbs in cooler weather - this is why it is planted in the fall and harvested the following summer. Once the temperatures warm up the plant will stop growing and start to dry out. If the conditions are right this will lead to a regular head of garlic that has excellent storage properties. </p><p>I am primarily interested in growing garlic as a perennial, leaving it in the ground as it goes dormant over the summer. This means the clove will turn into a bulb after one season, and then this bulb will become many cloves, and they will continue multiplying in this way. This forms a garlic clump that will produce small wet bulbs, leaves and scapes in quantity. These are all crops in their own right. At any point you can divide the clump and plant out individual bulbs to start new patches. This is easier than growing it as an annual because there is no need to worry about getting the right conditions for proper storage bulb formation. I don't like weeding or watering if I don't have to, so why not grow it as a perennial? The downside is that it is way less productive and there is no crop that can be stored for very long. I like fermenting garlic to make it last longer. However there is no reason you cannot also grow it as an annual in addition to the perennial patches if it is important to have storage bulbs.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/qualr1ll231v" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A. sativum.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Allium Tricoccum 'Ramp' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Bulb, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Bulb, seed.

I like to think of them as being more efficient producers of food because of this - many more popular vegetables need lots of nutrients, but turnips can create the same amount of food with a lot less. So you get more mileage from your soil with them, at least that's my thought process. This is probably one of the reasons they used to be a lot more common, before fertilizer was so readily available. </p><p>Of all the species in the Brassica genus, I think turnips show the most potential. They can be eaten for their leaves or flowering shoots, just like the others. In fact, they are often just as good as the others in this regard. But they also have a root! So not only do they do what the others do, they also provide a great source of energy in the form of a taproot on top of that. This is great for two reasons. One, it is an additional harvest. Two, it is a wonderful way to feed the soil. So even if you don't care about the root, you can harvest the leaves and let the root die, aerating and feeding the soil! Just like other taproots, if you filled a bed with turnips and then let them die in the soil, the improvements would be massive in just a single season. But none of the other taprooted plants create such high quality leaves, and very few of them grow as easily as the turnip. </p><p>I think there is potential to use turnips as the foundation for breeding a super-mustard. In my imagination this is a mustard that makes a fat taproot, produces an abundance of mild leaves and tender flowering shoots, and only sets seed after overwintering. Now that would be nice, right?</p><p>They seem more resilient than other mustards, especially for summer-growth. Plus they are super easy to overwinter, so they basically grow year round. Overwintered plants can produce a significant amount of greens. Let best plants go to seed, harvest others before flowering. Used to pelt ancient roman governors, not just a nutritious food but also a revolutionary weapon!

Young rhizomes can be eaten (which is almost all of them if grown as an annual). Can be a perennial in warmer parts of the country. If growing as a perennial, to harvest just slice off the newer rhizome with a shovel and pull them up, leaving the older ones in the ground. Shoots are a vegetable as well but seems to be rarely eaten and less practical if growing as an annual. Once the main shoots become big enough, new shoots will come up as the rhizome expands. Heavy wind may rip some leaves or bend over some stalks but these plants are pretty tough. Flowers start to form in October here, but rarely forms seed.

Many know of the other gems bred by andean cultures but few are familiar with this one. First off, the growth is easy. Despite the tropical appearance, it can produce even in temperate climates with relatively short seasons. It can grow in tough soil as long as it gets enough water. People say it needs consistently moist soil, and while it does prefer this, it certainly does not need it. The soil can dry out no problem. In my area it has no pests of any significance. They are susceptible to viruses, however. </p><p>Second, it produces tons of top growth with nice, thick leaves that are not only stunning but make perfect mulch when the plant is harvested. I would grow this plant just for the mulch even if it didn't produce an edible root! And lastly, it is productive. In temperate climates with good conditions expect yields of at least 5 pounds per plant. The only issue is poor storage, although this isn't a problem if the root is brought indoors and stored in a cool, slightly moist medium during the coldest part of the year. I use coco coir in a bucket. </p><p>After harvesting I typically divide the rhizome by pulling the stems apart - they form somewhat natural divisions this way. You will then be left with a about a dozen rhizome chunks connected to top growth. Cut off the top growth and use as mulch. Wash the rhizomes. They have layers of skin on them - leave as much of this on as possible to improve storage. I peel off most of the old mushy brown skin but try to leave most of the fresh skin on. Although I do remove some to make cleaning easier because bugs like to hide in the cracks. Overall it is easy to clean because the rhizomes grow so close to the surface of the soil and the skin doesn't absorb any dirt like potatoes sometimes do. The rhizomes are also quite beautiful - the photos online do not do them justice. </p><p>They can be baked uncovered with their skin, and once cooked the skin is easily removed. Or you can peel it beforehand and eat it whole. Cook well until the inside is completely soft. The flesh is quite neutral in flavor but slightly sweet. Similar to a potato but less palatable overall. </p><p>Plants sold with viruses are common. <b>C. indica</b> can be grown and used the same way but there is no reason to do this because the yields are much lower. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/q2oloee4saj8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. edulis.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Chaerophyllum Bulbosum 'Root Chervil' | Biennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.

Most do not reliably overwinter below Z8. In colder areas, bring the corms indoors over winter and store them in a cool, slightly moist medium (same as you would a canna rhizome). They are better producers when annually harvested and separated. They prefer sun but will tolerate a good amount of shade. The more water they have the better, but are fine with normal garden conditions as well. Many are under the impression taro can only be grown in tropical climates, but this isn't true. It will still produce in temperate climates if you have the right variety!</p><p>Taro is a plant that you need to be familiar with how each specific variety is eaten. With varieties like Tsurunoko or Miyako, the main corm is too acrid but the dormant cormels are the main crop. Others are used for the main corm, and some others may be used only for the leaves. Corms are formed continuously as the plants grows, so even if it doesn't grow very long you can still get something out of it. If not for eating at least to replant next season. High on my list is the variety 'Iliuaua' as it is very hardy and productive, but I haven't found anyone selling it yet.</p><p><b>C. gigantea</b> is used only for its leaf stems, the corm is not eaten. The leaf stems are an excellent vegetable, great for soup and produced in quantity, known as Bac Ha. Many references indicate they need to be peeled, although I believe this may only apply to the older and tougher stems. I have eaten tender stems without peeling and they have been very pleasant. Some clones such as 'Thailand Giant' or similar ones sold in nurseries are not used for food and are less hardy. However the common variety used for food can be found on ebay or etsy. This species seems tougher than taro, I believe it is less domesticated. Spreads by stolon, so after a season of growth it will start to form patches. </p><p>Given the large leaves and how vigorously this plant grows, it is also a good mulch plant. This species overwinters in my climate with no protection, even with wet soil, sprouting in late June. I imagine it could overwinter even in colder areas (I have seen reports of it overwintering in Z6). However it gets off to a very slow start when grown as a perennial in this climate, and the fact that is sprouts only when rain is becoming infrequent doesn't help either. Will tolerate fairly deep shade but prefers sun.</p><p>Plants in this genus are very closely related to those in the Alocasia genus, some of which are used as food as well. Bac Ha is often incorrectly identified as coming from this genus (even in a reference book I have). I don't think any Alocasia species are cultivated for food in temperate climates.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/ucu1cic20gcn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. esculenta.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/qln6efh76csm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. gigantea.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Crepidiastrum Sonchifolium 'Goddeulbbaegi' '고들빼기' | Biennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Uncommon, bitter vegetable in the daisy family.

Both seem to prefer shelter from heat. Despite this, I think in my climate it's worth letting them get a bit sunburnt if you have to because the extra sun will mean better rhizome production. If growing as a perennial I wouldn't say that, but as an annual it just seems more practical. And the good news is that even with a very short growing season, even with less than ideal conditions, they will still produce. Nothing amazing, but definitely enough to still be worth it, especially if growing a few. And they are garnishes so you don't necessarily need a lot of it. Plus the leaves make great mulch anyway.

They don't like staying in the ground for very long, many of them rotting and dying. I am currently trying to get a population going that can grow over a longer period of time (preferably the entire growing season if need be), survive the winter, and then produce seed the following year. Add to these difficulties that not all varieties are hardy enough to survive a winter here. So a frustrating plant but with the right selection it should have great potential.</p><p>They have good qualities if not for their short and fickle lifespans. Seeds germinate very well and even young plants are fairly drought tolerant. The young plants are able to grow right through low-growing weeds because the leaves shoot upwards as soon as they start growing. This allows them to handle competition well and poke through to the sun fairly quickly. Can be used to improve soil in the same way as a radish, although the roots tend to be smaller. Has some very poisonous lookalikes, so be careful. Let best plants go to seed, harvest others before flowering. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/9htj0rndubeq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">D. carota sativa.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Dioscorea B<b>atatas</b> 'Chinese Yam' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber, leaf, aerial tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Aerial tuber.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Sometimes referred to as <b>D. polystachya, </b>although I don't know if they are actually the same species or not. The old name is<b> D. opposita</b>. Most yams are only grown in the tropics (or grown as annuals), but this species is particularly cold hardy. Aerial tubers can easily spread and propagate themselves, best planted in a spot where it cannot escape and where management is easy. Roots are fragile, should be grown in bag/tube/barrel that can be easily dug up without disturbing root. Plastic drainage pipes are used as well. Root takes about 2-3 years to harvest, aerial tubers and leaves are a good crop until then. </p><p>If growing for aerial tuber crop, best to set aside some roots to leave in ground indefinitely, as older roots will produce more and larger aerial tubers. Needs a large trellis to climb on. When planting aerial tubers, be aware they may take weeks or months to send up leaves, so start them early. It's a great plant but given that it's difficult to harvest straight out of the ground and that it can spread rapidly by bulbils makes it more annoying to grow than other perennials. Once you have a good setup in a good spot it's no problem though.</p><p>The book <i>Ethnobotany and Useful Resource Plants of Dokdo and Ulleung Island in Korea</i> indicates that the young leaves and tender new growth of this particular species can be eaten after being cooked. I was a bit skeptical having never seen this references anywhere else, but the creator of <a href="https://sesamesprinkles.home.blog/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sesame Sprinkles</a> confirmed that korean recipes that make use of the leaves do in fact exist. She informed me they are usually pickled in soy sauce (마잎장아찌).

If soil is not loose it should be loosened before planting, otherwise yields will be significantly decreased.</p><p>I am currently interested in figuring out a way to disturb the soil only once per year. Potatoes are planted in spring. After they die back in the summer they stay in the ground until frost. Then the bed is dug up, the potatoes are harvested, and seed potatoes are replanted right away. These seed potatoes will stay in the ground until sprouting in spring. The cycle is repeated. This allows me to grow other plants that need the entire growing season alongisde the potatoes.. Digging up a bed in the middle of the season frustrates me as I am forced to reset the bed. I'd rather grow them among a bunch of other plants that can keep growing after the potatos die back. This is essentially rotating the bed without reseting it. However, keeping potatoes in the ground for so long makes them more susceptible to disaese, insects and rot. </p><p>The soil should be loose and well draining. Overly moist soil will encourage rot. The potatoes should be high dormancy to prevent early sprouting in the ground.

Many species commonly used, some for seed production, others for leaves. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/21hgamcmgi0d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amaranthus spp.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Atriplex Hortensis 'Orach' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer and bunny sensitive. </p><p><b>Status:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Good species for leaf production, easy spinach substitute. </p><p><br></p><h3>Celosia Argentea 'Plumed Cockscomb' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>All reports indicate it must be cooked (unlike other species in the amaranth family listed here).

It can be direct seeded into a compacted lawn and grow just fine without irrigiation (in my climate), without any weeding, competing well with grass. This is a rare and valuable quality. It is an efficient producer of biomass, the thick stems of a mature plant make great mulch. It would probably be a good addition to compost as well.</p><p>The height of the plants makes them a natural companion for vining edibles, such as pole beans. The structure of the plant also creates very little shade provided they are not planted too densley, allowing them to be grown in garden beds and add a layer of vertical height without shading out other crops. The only problem is that heavy winds will often bend them over. Some will continue growing all bendy but some will just snap. Planting them densely helps mitigate this, but also makes the prospect of growing them in garden beds less realistic.</p><p>The leaves are a protien-rich vegetable and are produced in quantity, although quite thin. <b>H. sabdariffa</b> is the standard for using as a vegetable, however, and grows much smaller.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/n4p0ji80ca8j" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">H. cannabinum.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Hordeum Vulgare 'Barley' | Annual </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Seed. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">CALORIE CROP</b></p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>This is one of the easiest grains to grow, particularly well suited for dry soil.

Tons of options within this genus. This species is the classic red raspberry bush. It has a perennial root system that send up new canes every year, but each cane only fruits the second year before dying. Everbearing varieties will fruit twice before the canes die. Thorned varieties seem to be more vigorous. The thimbleberry, <b>R. parviflorus</b>, barely fruits at all but doesn't have any thorns, grows taller and the canes live longer and continue producing. The Japanese wineberry, <b>R. phoenicolasius</b>, is an extremely thorny scrambling bush although it can be trellised. <b>R. fruticosus</b> is the blackberry. Of all the cane types in this genus I think thornless raspberries are the easiest to manage. There are also groundcovers with modest fruiting like <b>R. calycinoides</b>, the Taiwanese creeping raspberry. It is small and not the most productive crop but covers ground well and grows very easily. It will tolerate considerable shade and competition. <b>R. nepalensis</b>, the Nepalese raspberry,<b> </b>is also a ground cover but with larger fruits.

Seeds should be scarified and soaked as they are tough to germinate Related to the common snake gourd, <b>T. cucumerina. </b></p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/t4oroed2n8r9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">T. kirilowii.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Vaccinium C<b>orymbosum</b> 'Blueberry' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Fruit.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, cutting.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. Rich soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>This species is the popular blueberry with two main forms - lowbush and highbush. Lowbush is the cold hardy wild form that is a smaller plant with smaller berries. Highbush is the cultivated form, a bigger plant with bigger berries and better heat tolerance. There are hybrids as well. This species is the most common but there are many other worthwhile species in this genus. All need acidic soil, growing naturally in acidic forest soil, so may not be the easiest plant for the backyard garden without some preparation. However, I think that making sure there is a lot of organic matter in/on the soil is often good enough. Place it in a spot with rich soil, feed with compost and mulch heavily with garden debris. I am growing the 'Hardyblue' variety. I am also attempting to grow <b>V. gaultheriifolium</b>, the chinese blueberry.

This species shoul be very cold hardy. Wonderful plant that serves double duty as a fruit and vegetable. Fruits can be eaten fresh and pads should be cooked. Both fruit and pads have spines that must be removed, as well as invisible barbed hairs called glochids that are painful to the touch. Harvest with gloves or tongs and then thoroughly burn or scrub the entire pad. When growing any cactus with glochids, be sure to inform visitors not to touch any part of the plant. This is especially important for spineless varieties as the tendency is to want to touch them. <b>O. cacanapa</b> is a bit less cold hardy but has larger pads. For the sake of science I rubbed my hands on my spineless variety and it does definitely have glochids as well. It is also a lighter blue color which is pretty. <b>O. stricta</b> should also be suitable for cold winters. Many other cold hardy species, lots of species in this genus are used for food. The amount of spines differs between species and which form you have. Many species have spineless varieties (they all likely still have glochids though). All have amazing potential as an easy crop for poor soil, with the benefit of little wildlife pressure. Pads can be rooted easily, best to get these or live plants for a quick start. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/30vjimlpc1l4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">O. humifosa.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/k3laof2jsb8a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">O. cacanapa.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Portulaca Oleracea 'Purslane' | Annual </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">DROUGHT TOLERANT</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Groundcover that should self-seed and spread easily.

During hot and dry months it gets more bitter, maybe better for cooking. Grows quickly and can blanket large areas if left unchecked. Very well suited for growing in pots, it will hang over the edges in a very classy way. A useful vegetable that doesn't get the attention it deserves! There might be a few different forms, make sure to get one specifically used as food. There are also many edible sedums that are native if you are into that.  </p><p>As far as edible succulents go, most immediately think of purslane.

However, it can be challening to grow in hot climates as it prefers cooler weather. My strategy is to plant it in a sheltered and relatively shady area. There are not many references to this species being edible and it's not as common as other bamboos. <i>Bamboos: A Gardener's Guide To Their Cultivation In Temperate Climates</i> does indicate it is edible though. <b>C. gigantea </b>is also noteworthy as it produces one of the densest and thickest (1.75") canes of all cold hardy clumping bamboos.

Unlike aloe this should be hardy to my area! This species is said to be used on the skin and I believe the original source for this is <i>The Aloes Of South Africa</i>:</p><blockquote>Mr. Frank Brownlee, Magistrate at Mount Ayliff, East Griqualand, in March 1925, records (in litt.): "It is an interesting fact that the juice of this plant mixed with water is sometimes used by the natives for washing their bodies. The washing is said to have a tonic and refreshing effect on the system."</blockquote><p>It is diluted in water before application but in what ratio I do not know. Unfortunately I have not found any other sources that discuss the medicinal application of this species outside of research papers that are only analyzing certain compounds within the plant. These, of course, cannot be used to deduce the safeness of the plant as a whole. </p><p>But given that this species is potentially very cold hardy and may have similar effects to common aloe (although applied differently), I believe it is worth more research. It could be a local, sustainable source of natural skin moisturizer. When my plants are big enough I will try using it and report back.</p><p><b>A. vera</b> is the standard and is easily grown indoors.
