<h1>Crop Research </h1><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Stretching my arm towards the sky, I find breakfast. Lowering my hand to the ground, I find lunch. Burying my fist in the earth, I find dinner. </i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p>The 6th great extinction is here. Climate collapse is unstoppable. Civilization can no longer support us. Research into resilient crops for food security in temperate climates. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Philosophy</h2><p><br></p><p>Everyday I ask myself, what should I do? As our planet barrels towards an uninhabitable future and our governments become more repressive, what can I do to stop all this? The most important realization, I think, is that none of us are going to change the world. We are not going to save the planet from another extinction (it's already happening). We are not going to save the billions of human and non-human lives that will perish. An ecological socialist utopia is exactly that, a utopia. It's simply not going to happen within our lifetimes, or possibly ever. The destructive power of civilization, both physical and psychological, has been growing for thousands of years now. History has made it very clear time and time again - as a species we are not prepared to overcome this sociological phenomenon. And so we live in a very interesting time, perhaps one of the few generations of humans to witness earth during the momentous shift climate collapse is causing. Nothing like this has ever happened in the entire history of humanity.</p><p>In the face of all this, why do I spend my time researching and growing food? I wish I could do more, believe me. I wish I could stop the murder, the torture, the enslavement, the destruction. But realistically, my influence will be quite limited. I believe having a relationship with nature is one of the easiest and most direct ways to feel satisfied, loved and empowered. And only individuals engaged with nature are capable of forming communities that truly provide for our physical, social and spiritual needs. These communities then have the potential to be the building blocks of a new society, to form a federation of self-sufficient tribes. Keeping land at the forefront of both individual and societal success is an effective path forward because it is meaningful at every level - whether you just want to not hate the world, or you want to improve the living conditions of your community, or you want to build a new society. Ultimately, all we are fighting for is a peaceful relationship with the land and with each other. And growing food is a concrete way of working towards that without depending on people who don't care about us or our planet. There's nothing glamorous about this, it's hands in the dirt kind of change, but it's real and it happens right before your eyes.</p><p>Growing food for yourself doesn't have to be hard, lots of vegetables even grow like weeds! Grass lawns were once a symbol of wealth, yet now they sit in front of even the most impoverished homes. This paradox was intentionally designed through generations of propaganda. I am trying to find an easy way out, a way for anyone to grow lots of food and medicine on whatever land they have access to. Only within the last few decades did we gain access to thousands of seeds from every corner of the earth. Consider how many generations of work went into domesticating and improving these crops throughout human history! This is the most powerful gift our ancestors could have bestowed upon us, a privilage few could even dream of until now. I have a vision for a garden that uses the most resiliant food crops from every country, every culture, throughout history. The notes below are written with that vision in mind.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Methods</h2><p><br></p><p>The methods we use to plant, grow, harvest and propagate crops can make all the difference in both the health of the ecosystem and how much work it requires to maintain.</p><ul><li><b>Give more than you take.</b> Every year that you are gardening the soil should be improving. Even if you aren't getting amazing production right away, adding fertility to the soil is like depositing money in the bank. It's going to make everything so much easier down the line.</li><li><b>Prioritize the population.</b> Some plants die, that is inevitable. Allowing the stronger plants to grow and propagate will lead to a more resilient population better suited to your specific circumstances. It's a better use of time to encourage the plants doing well than it is to try to save the plants doing poorly. Of course, sometimes plants just need a helping hand while they are getting established. </li><li><b>Select by harvesting. </b>If some plants within a population aren't doing well, these are the first ones that should be harvested! They can eaten or put to good use, allowing you to leave the best plants to go to seed. Over the course of many seasons, this will result in a much stronger population. </li><li><b>Propagate when harvesting.</b> When harvesting perennial root crops, unless you have more than you need, always propagate at least as much as you are taking. That means when I harvest bulbs or tubers, I can eat a few and replant a few in different spots. Or if I'm unable to divide the root, I can make sure it has produced enough seedlings to keep the population multiplying. It's a small amount of work that goes a long way.</li><li><b>Think 3 years ahead. </b>Many perennials will take 2-3 years to get established, and it can take this long for some annuals or biennials to really become self-sustaining. Most of the time, I'm thinking a few years ahead, and I'm willing to forego any big harvests for the first year or two just so I can learn what the plants need while I establish a strong population. Patience is key.</li><li><b>Plant in different niches. </b>I would much rather have a crop growing abundantly in one niche than have it growing poorly in 3 different niches. It's impossible to know exactly what conditions a plant will need without some experimenting. I usually try to plant in a few different areas if I have enough seed/starters - more or less sun, more or less water, different kinds of soil, different microclimates. Even if only one survives but it is clearly in the right spot, I consider that a success because I know it will keep growing without my help. Many seed packets come with hundreds of seeds, so use that to your advantage!</li><li><b>Look at the ground. </b>Wooded areas that receive lots of leaf litter or debris may be better suited for shade-tolerant perennials and plants that spread by rhizomes. A thick layer of mulch can make it hard for seeds to reach the soil and germinate. A managed garden bed with a thinner layer of mulch makes it easier for annuals and biennials to reseed themselves. If you're planting directly into a grass field or lawn, think about plants that thrive in poor soil and can easily compete with grass.</li><li><b>Messy gardens are healthy gardens. </b>Subdue your desire to make everything look neat and proper. Home gardeners don't need to grow crops in rows like some farms or nurseries. A diversity of plants living alongside each other makes for more resilient systems and more fun when roaming through the garden. Returning plant material back to the soil is important as well. A layer of sticks, leaves, grass and dead plants on the ground will do wonders. If you have too much and don't want your mulch layer to be too thick, the rest can go into compost.</li><li><b>Curate instead of controlling.</b> Garden beds usually have a host of plants that grow whether you like it or not. Instead of simply ripping them all up, work with them so you can use the beneficial ones to your advantage. Typically this means removing those that spread too aggressively or create too much shade, but letting others cover bare soil and fill in gaps between crops. And even if I know I'm going to remove some plants in the future, there's no rush! Letting plants grow allows their roots to work the soil and provides you with more biomass for mulching or composting when you do cut them down.</li><li><b>Don't have expectations.</b> You will be much more successful if you are open to growing what your land is well-suited for. Starting with a long list of expected crops and yields will lead to disappointment. Instead, focus on trying to find the right plants that your land can grow abundantly. This may mean you have to rethink what you're eating, but for most of history we have eaten only what the land around us was capable of producing. </li><li><b>Collect local materials. </b>Whenever I'm driving around I always look out for leaves, grass clippings or branches on the curb. These can be used for compost, mulching, or filling in large pots to extend your soil. I have a bunch of old garbage cans in my greenhouse - after drilling holes in the bottom, I fill the bottom half with branches and leaves, then add soil and compost on top.  I also collect mushrooms from nearby wooded areas to add to my compost.</li><li><b>Consider how it's harvested.</b> Some root crops like potatoes, oca, or sunchoke need to be dug up from the ground, disturbing the surrounding soil. Plant these alongside other root crops or annuals that will be able to reseed themselves. Some other root crops like radishes or turnips can be harvested with little disturbance to surrounding plant life, allowing more flexibility for companion plants.</li><li><b>The devil is in the details.</b> The best gardens, in my mind, grow so naturally that it appears they haven't been designed at all. But this is because the caretakers have such a nuanced understanding of how plants grow and interact with each other that they are able to work with nature instead of against it. And these gardens often require so little effort that it seems anyone could care for them. But this is the result of mastering an art - an elegance in which no movements are wasted, and every intervention is meaningful. Even without all this mumbo jumbo, it is often just a matter of finding the right seed with the right genetics that will grow well in your specific circumstances.

differ in other climates. Entries designated with ♥ are crops I believe have the most potential given their growing patterns and edible yields. I typically try to use the most common English name for the plant, although it can be confusing for some species that have no good names or that share names with other species. The Latin name is always the most accurate.</p><p><b>Edible:</b> Useful edible parts. Not comprehensive, not a reference, only a starting point. Do not eat anything you are not 100% familiar with. Always consult multiple sources and verify with research. See resources above. Usually if the leaf is edible then so is the tender new growth (harvested with some of the new stem). Shoot refers only to the young growth of the plant when it first emerges from the ground.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Useful methods of propagation. Usually seed, stem cutting, or rhizome/tuber. Seeds that prefer cold stratification are often noted as such. Usually I try to get bare roots or potted plants if a seed is difficult to germinate, but I do have lots of pots with soil and seed that sit in my greenhouse for however many seasons it takes for them to germinate. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Rough guidelines for minimum sun requirements. Deep shade (≈70%) → Shade (≈50%) → Part Shade (≈30%) → Sun (≈10%). I usually find that plants do alright with less sun than what is typically suggested. Most of the time, if a plant prefers shade, it will also prefer rich and moist soil. And keep in mind that just because a plants prefers sun doesn't mean it can handle the scorching heat summer often brings.</p><p><b>Wildlife:</b> Impact of wildlife on plant. We have lots of deer as well as chipmunks, rabbits and birds that live nearby. I try to grow enough food for everyone, but I can't let them eat everything! I have some fenced areas for sensitive plants I don't want being bothered.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Everything else. Observations about growth habits, useful varieties, hardiness, harvesting, interactions with other plants and more. Plants with photos were grown in Maryland, roughly Z7. Winters have been mild lately, only a few inches of snow and some ice. Plenty of rain most of the year, although the ground can dry out in the summer. Soil has poor-drainage and some clay, but is mostly good.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Herbs</h2><p><br></p><h3>Agastache Rugosa 'Korean Mint' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Members of this genus are known as hyssops. I love the aroma of this species, makes a great tea. <b>A. foeniculum</b> is common as well. Some others.</p><p><br></p><h3>Anethum Graveolens 'Dill' | Annual </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Will bolt from heat, easy to grow in small gaps. Good pollinator and great seed production, should reseed itself easily. Useful herb for pickling. </p><p><br></p><h3>Angelica Sylvestris 'Wild Angelica' | Biennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>This species, unlike some others in this genus, can be eaten as a garnish or a vegetable. <b>A. gigas</b> and <b>A. acutiloba</b> have only edible leaves, the latter being used for its medicinal roots as well. Many others in this genus with different edible properties.</p><p><br></p><h3>Artemisia P<b>rinceps</b> 'Mugwort' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. Easy to grow in poor soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>This is the Japanese species, used in some traditional Asian cuisine. <b>A. vulgaris</b> is common mugwort and there are many other edible and medicinal varieties. Seems to grow quite easily, should be great for shady spots. Said to be a lucid dreaming aid, can be infused as tea or smoked. Tender new growth can be eaten as vegetable.</p><p><br></p><h3>Asarum C<b>anadense</b> 'Wild Ginger' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Rhizome.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed. Cold stratify.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Rhizomes can be used as a garnish. Always eat in moderation as there are reports of toxicity for parts of the plant. Don't eat leaves. This species is most commonly sold here, but <b>A. europaeum</b> is also used the same way. Despite its limited use it makes a beautiful groundcover for shady spots. Grows alongside ramps in the wild, may be useful to imitate this in the garden. Rhizomes will give you a quicker start.</p><p><br></p><h3>Chenopodium Ambrosioides 'Epazote' | Annual </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Easy to grow in poor soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Mexican herb that grows and reseeds itself easily. Not the most versatile herb given its aroma. May be useful as deer deterrent. </p><p><br></p><h3>Diplotaxis Tenuifolia 'Wild Rocket' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>There are a few genera with species that get referred to as cress or rocket, so it's easy to get confused. This is a standard perennial species that's easy to find, a useful alternative to arugula. Used in moderation as the taste can be sharp. Should do well in shade.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Eruca Vesicaria Sativa 'Arugula' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Useful garnish that reseeds itself, works wonderfully as a sort of groundcover in between larger crops. Prefers some shade so it won't bolt as quickly. Many different varieties to experiment with, some have much larger leaves than others.</p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/20g55ldsejho" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">These plants bolted almost immediately due to the hot weather and being in full sun, but that's okay with me because it means more seed to spread around.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/po49td6eeiis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Close up of flowers.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Foeniculum Vulgare 'Fennel' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, stem.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Hardy perennial herb.</p><p><br></p><h3>Inula Helenium 'Elecampane' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Often used medicinally but it has a place in the kitchen if you are willing to experiment. Young leaves are edible although may not be palatable. I think the real potential lies in the root - it can be grated and used as a garnish. Very cold hardy. Leaves smell skunky, may be useful as deer deterrent. </p><p><br></p><h3>Lavandula Angustifolia 'Lavender' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes:</b> Compact herb that grows similar to rosemary but more tolerant of soil, sun and cold. Limited culinary use but may be useful for its wonderful aroma when making hygiene products such as soap.</p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/cfa1rl77b4ge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A cutting that's been growing for a year in a sunny spot.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/2c9uoikltot8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Close up of leaves.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Mentha spp. 'Mint' | Perennial 🖤</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. Easy to grow in poor soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: M. requienii</b>, corsican mint, is the only species in this genus I've come across that forms a good groundcover. Others, like <b>M. spicata</b> (spearmint), will grow up to a few feet and do well in almost any conditions. Not preferable for garden beds, may be better suited where it can be given space and managed easily. I like planting mints in shady spots as it slows down the growth and doesn't take space away from other plants that actually need more sun.</p><p><br></p><h3>Monarda Fisulosa 'Bee Balm' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed, stem.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.

Hardy to about Z6 or Z7, but there are more cold hardy species as well. Most species in this genus seem to produce edible roots. Likes some shade as the young growth can be sensitive to heat and frost. Tubers grow larger every year, often harvested at 2-3 years old. Amazing potential as a root crop for the forest garden, especially the vining varieties. Plant dies back in winter, is not too aggressive and prefers its feet in the shade. All of this makes it a perfect candidate for climbing on bushes and trees without strangling them.</p><p><br></p><h3>Crepidiastrum Sonchifolium 'Goddeulbbaegi' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.

Aerial tubers can spread and propagate themselves easily, best planted in a spot where it cannot escape and where management is easy. Roots are fragile, should be grown in bag/tube/barrel that can be easily dug up without disturbing root. Plastic drainage pipes may work well, this is the method I will be trying. Root takes about 2-3 years to harvest, aerial tubers are good crop until then. If growing for aerial tuber crop, best to set aside some roots to leave in ground indefinitely, as older roots will produce more and larger aerial tubers. Needs a large trellis to climb on. The book <i>Ethnobotany and Useful Resource Plants of Dokdo and Ulleung Island in Korea</i> indicates that the leaves of this particular species can also eaten after being cooked. <b>D. japonica </b>is the Japanese species, fairly similar.</p><p><br></p><h3>Helianthus Tuberosus 'Sunchoke' | Perennial 🖤</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, seed.

Best planted in a spot where it cannot escape and where management is easy. Roots contain large amounts of inulin. Keeping roots in ground during winter will help reduce this, as will certain methods of preparation (such as pickling/fermenting). Harvesting in early spring will also give you sweeter tubers. Varieties can differ a lot in taste, size and shape. May be useful as barrier or trellis, some varieties can grow 10+ feet.

Can be difficult to grow from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Establishing a perennial potato patch poses two main problems: disease pressure builds up and tubers may not survive a winter dormancy when left in the ground. Wild potatoes do not suffer from these problems because they are often resistant to both disease and frost, but many wild potatoes are either not safe to eat and/or difficult to harvest. Wild potatoes are also able to spread multiple feet each year via tubers attached to long stolons, allowing them to move around as they grow. Domestication has made potatoes more stationary and more edible but has also weakened their resistances. Some species form tubers during short days in fall and some are day-neutral. <b>S. curtilobum</b> and&nbsp;<b>S. ajanhuiri</b> may be good options.</p><p><br></p><h3>Solanum Peruvianum 'Peruvian Tomato' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Tuber, seed.

Wet soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Also referred to as elephant's ear, different varieties have different edible properties. Be sure to ask exactly which parts of the plant are edible for the form you are buying. That being said, leaf stems of certain forms provide a wonderful, spongy vegetable unlike anything else. Unfurled or young leaves may make good vegetable as well. All parts of plant contain calcium oxalate, so must be cooked thoroughly to be safe to eat. Preparation varies, best to do research beforehand. Useful for wet and shady areas. Some varieties are cold hardy to Z7. Can grow over 5 feet tall, good potential to be interplanted with shade-tolerant vining plants that can climb on its long stems. Will flower in right conditions but doesn't seem to in this climate.</p><p><br></p><h3>Cryptotaenia Japonica 'Mitsuba' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Also called Japanese honewort. <b>C. canadensis</b> is American variety. </p><p><br></p><h3>Cynara Cardunculus 'Cardoon' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, stem, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Cardoon is globe artichoke's primitive and hardy cousin. Artichoke should survive in my climate but for now cardoon will suffice. Bracts are said to be edible in same way as artichoke but I cannot imagine anyone bothering with that given how much smaller they are. The heart of the flower should be the main crop here, although stems also have a long history of use, maybe good for soup.

Not very cold hardy, will see if it survives here. Unclear if a single plant can produce seed.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Hemerocallis</b> spp. 'Daylily' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Flower, shoot.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Root.</p><p><b>Conditions: </b>Deep shade to sun. Easy to grow in poor soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, a favorite of theirs, only eat flowers though. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>There is much drama about daylilies online, many people seem to have bad reactions despite a long history of edible use. Supposedly all species are fine, but my recommendation is to stick to those with a history of being eaten. This includes <b>H. fulva</b>, <b>H. flava</b>, and <b>H. middendorffii</b>. Flowers are eaten as buds or fully opened, always cooked. Traditionally they are also often dried or pickled, both of which should make them more digestible if that's an issue. Shoots are cooked as vegetables as well. Daylilies will grow in most soils and seem to do fine in fairly deep shade. Would make an easy understory for fruit trees. </p><p><br></p><h3>Hirschfeldia Incana 'Hoary Mustard' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, seed pod.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.

Easy to grow in poor soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive, one of their favorites. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Supposedly all species of hosta are edible but this species is the standard in Japan as far as I'm aware. Young shoots and very young leaves make unique vegetables, cut once and then allow plant to grow. Tolerant of most conditions. Useful for deep shade where edible options are limited. Although the deer love it, there shouldn't be a problem harvesting the shoots as they typically only eat it later on in the growth cycle.</p><p><br></p><h3>Ipomoea Aquatica 'Water Spinach' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. Wet soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>In the same genus as sweet potato and morning glory (with similarly beautiful flowers). Common vegetable in southeast Asia, normally grown in more tropical climates but seems to have potential for growing and reseeding itself in temperate climates. Tender new growth is edible. Grows narrow leaves at first and as the plant matures the new leaves get much larger. Needs wet soil, should do well with shelter if there is enough light. </p><p><br></p><h3>Ligularia Fischeri 'Gomchwi' | Perennial 🖤</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. Germination is poor. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to part shade.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Leafy vegetable from Korea, often used as a wrap. Amazing potential as a perennial groundcover for shady spots. Could be planted beneath trees or be interplanted with other shade-tolerant species. Some other species of Ligularia also have edible leaves, but none others are cultivated for this purpose. </p><p><br></p><h3><b>Matteuccia Struthiopteris</b> 'Fiddlehead Fern' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoots.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to part shade. Wet soil.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Consume in moderation and always prepare according to traditional methods, may be harmful in large quantities. Unfurled shoots (known as fiddleheads) only. Another great edition for shady spots, should spread nicely. There are a variety of ferns with varying edible properties, but this is the standard in America and the easiest to source.</p><p><br></p><h3>Ornithogalum Pyrenaicum 'Bath Asparagus' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Inflorescence.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Young flowering shoots considered similar to asparagus.

Young leaf stems, leaves and inflorescence. The inflorescence appear as spring shoots, one of the earliest vegetables, should be the best harvest from this plant although very bitter. Can be an aggressive spreader once established, plant where it will not escape and can be easily managed. Useful for wet and shady areas, similar conditions as taro. <b>P. japonicus var. giganteus</b> is a larger variety, growing taller with wider leaves, affect on edible yield is uncertain. Related to <b>P. frigidus</b>, arctic butterbur, which has edible properties as well.</p><p><br></p><h3>Peucedanum Japonicum 'Japanese Hog Fennel' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Stem, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Rhizome, seed. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Young growth eaten.

Wonderful plant that serves double duty as a fruit and vegetable. Fruits can be eaten fresh and pads can be cooked. Both fruit and pads have spikes that must be removed, as well as a multitude of invisible barbed hairs (glochids) that are painful to the touch. Harvest with gloves or tongs and then thoroughly burn or scrub the barbed hairs off. Amazing potential as an easy crop for poor soil, with the benefit of little wildlife pressure. Pads can be rooted easily, best to get these for a quick start. </p><p><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/ovs4972oglnd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">These pads were removed in winter and sent to me, which is not ideal but looks like they will still do fine.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/1r0nsndclcu3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">They root very easily.</a></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Medicinal</h2><p><br></p><h3>Heimia Salicifolia 'Sun Opener' | Annual</h3><p><b>Medicinal: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Leaves are fermented in water and the resulting tea is drunk.
