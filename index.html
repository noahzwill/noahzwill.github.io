<h1>Food For The Extinction</h1><p><i>The 6th mass extinction is here. Climate collapse is unstoppable. Civilization can no longer sustain us. Research into resilient crops and natural cultivation methods for food security in temperate climates.</i></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>A Path Forward</h2><p>Everyday I ask myself, what should I do? As our planet barrels towards an uninhabitable future, our governments become more repressive and everyday life becomes more dystopian, what can I do to stop all this? The most important realization is that none of us are going to change the world. We are not going to save the planet from another extinction (it's already happening). We are not going to save the billions of human and non-human lives that will perish. Already over 80 billion land animals are killed each year for consumption, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Words cannot do justice to the absolutely immense horrors we are responsible for. This is the nightmare you cannot wake up from. Clinging to some vision of a better future is tempting, but the evidence against this couldn't be more obvious. The destructive power of civilization has been growing for thousands of years now. Behind all the lies about progress is the simple truth: our planet is dying and there is nothing we can do about it. And so we are perhaps one of the few generations of humans to live through the momentous shift climate collapse is causing. Nothing like this has ever happened in the entire history of humanity. Mankind is entering a new era.</p><p>In the face of all this, how can I be of any meaningful service? Why spend my time researching and growing food? I wish I could do more, believe me. I wish I could stop the murder, the torture, the enslavement, the destruction. But realistically, my influence will be quite limited. I believe having an interactive relationship with nature is one of the most direct ways to feel satisfied and empowered. And only individuals engaged with nature are capable of forming communities that truly provide for our physical, social and spiritual needs. When our empire inevitably collapses, these communities have the potential to be the building blocks of a new society, to form a federation of self-sufficient tribes. Keeping land at the forefront of both individual and societal success is an effective path forward because it is meaningful at every level - whether you just want to not hate the world, or you want to improve the living conditions of your community, or you want to build a new society. Even disregarding the bigger picture, this perspective is nothing but practical. How will you feed your family when industrial agriculture fails and supply chains fall apart? Growing food is a concrete way of solving a very real and imminent problem without depending on people who don't care about us or our planet. There's nothing glamorous about this, it's hands in the dirt kind of change, but it's real and it happens right before your eyes. </p><p>Growing food doesn't have to be hard, lots of vegetables even grow like weeds! Grass lawns were once a symbol of wealth, yet now they sit in front of even the most impoverished homes. This paradox was intentionally designed through generations of propaganda. For years I was utterly confused, why are some vegetables considered to grow too well and eradicated while right next door people go hungry? Is there an abundance of food or isn't there!? I will leave you to answer this yourself, but either way it certainly doesn't have to be this way. Only within the last few decades did we gain access to thousands of seeds from every corner of the earth. Consider how many generations of work went into finding, domesticating and improving these crops throughout human history! This is a privilege few could even dream of until now. As the world transforms into something entirely new, it has in the very same moment bestowed upon us the plants of salvation. And with them comes the power to create a landscape unlike any before in history. </p><p>This research is an attempt to prepare for the extinction and help communities build resilient food systems. Most people have land with poor soil and very little knowledge about growing food. Finding crops that can grow in this environment and provide real sustenance is therefore of the utmost importance. Ultimately all this may accomplish very little, but every day that a garden lives it serves the creatures within. </p><p>The list of plants below is only what I have been looking into or trying to grow myself, it is not meant to be anything beyond that. There are an endless number of food plants, but I mainly research those that are cultivated or those with qualities that make them good candidates for cultivation. I must also be able to get my hands on seeds, so that severely limits my options as well. The list will be expanded and updated as I grow more plants and learn new things.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Nevertheless, a new breed of explorers has arisen, those who are disenchanted with the bland products of the supermarkets, those who still feel the primordial urge to plant, those whose tastes are adventurous. There are those whose pocketbooks are thin who can benefit from green leaves easily grown at home. Finally, there are the few who recognize that the vegetables we emphasize now are but a part of a larger, and mostly still available heritage, a heritage whose potentials have still not been fully realized.</i></p><p><i>- Edible Leaves Of The Tropics </i></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>The Plants We Eat</h2><p>How do we even begin to feed ourselves? What are we growing and eating? I personally do not grow nearly enough food to feed myself (nor do I have the land to). It is a difficult task that most people throughout most of history have not attempted. Even after the advent of agriculture, a significant portion of food was often foraged from the local environment. But the natural abundance that once covered the earth has been almost completely destroyed. As agriculture evolved to power an ever-expanding civilization, forests were felled and landscapes were permanently disfigured. We burned down ecosystems masterfully designed over millennia, teeming with life and full of nutritious food, in an attempt to grow something a fraction as productive in their place, all with big clumsy hands and little human brains. The plants that sprouted in these graveyards were not grown for people, but markets and masters; they could not nourish us in the same way. All this is only to say that growing all of our own food in a truly compassionate and sustainable way requires a persistant effort and has not been the norm for any period of human history. But the old world is gone and it is never coming back, so we must do what we can given our circumstances. Growing only a portion of our food still has enormous benefits and can certainly create some sense of food security, even if it is not complete. So returning to our original question, what should we grow? What plants do people eat to survive? </p><p>The broadest pattern that emerges for practically any species on earth is that the foods that provide the most energy and nutrition (and are digestible by the specific anatomy of the creature) in any given landscape become primary sources of sustenance. That means a guerilla that has access to fruits will generally prioritize those over leaves. Eating 20 pounds of fruit is much easier than eating 20 pounds of leaves. And like many other mammals, humans gravitate towards high-density sources of energy like nuts, fruits, roots and seeds to sustain themselves. Leafy vegetables, while an essential addition to our diet, require a much larger quantity to provide the same amount of energy. </p><p>This happens to work out quite well for us because nuts and fruits are some of the easiest, most productive perennial crops. Even with a limited amount of space we have many options, including hazelnut, plum and mulberry. Once planted, they can often continue producing for decades - talk about a return on investment! Tree crops also require significantly less resources to produce, meaning they will often tolerate poorer soil and less frequent watering than many herbaceous crops. In this way they are extremely efficient at producing food. The benefits of trees are truly endless and there is no easier way to improve the health of a landscape. Fruit and nut trees are therefore the first priority for us and can make up a significant portion of our diet. </p><p>Root crops are also a very dense source of energy, often more so than fruit. They usually require more work, however, as soil may need to be built up and the crops must be regularly propagated, either by seed or division. Cold-hardy, perennial root crops usually need at least 2 years of growth before harvest. This includes plants like groundnut and doraji. However, some can be harvested every year like the sunchoke. While perennial roots are more work than simply picking fruit off a tree, they usually require very little maintenance once planted. Annual roots may require more work to grow, but can significantly expand our options with some heavy hitters like achira, taro or potato. Alongside nuts and fruits, roots are another significant addition to our diet. </p><p>Our next consideration is the smallest of the bunch: seeds. When people grow all their own food, seeds are usually how they do it. Seeds, including grains and pulses, are very calorically dense, can be eaten in quantity, and are easily stored or transported. This is why almost every civilization on earth has been built on them. But growing grains sustainably can be difficult - most often it results in a monoculture that degrades the soil while providing very little ecological value. And to top it all off, grains require the most labor of any food mentioned here to grow, harvest and process. This is not to say they should be avoided, only that how they are grown and incorporated into our diet needs to be reconsidered. Pulses can be a valuable addition for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil and help other crops grow. But even so, this category of foods is generally comprised of labor-intensive annuals that are difficult to incorporate into more permanent food systems. Ultimately it may be useful to think of seeds, grains, and pulses as another addition to a varied diet, and not necessarily the staple of every meal. </p><p>Finally, we arrive at leafy vegetables and the like. While they don't provide the bulk of our sustenance, they are necessary for vitamins and minerals (and flavor!). They also bring diversity and excitement to the garden. Here too we can focus on perennials that provide a crop every year with almost no effort after the initial planting. Plants like good king henry, turkish rocket and seombadi provide excellent perennial alternatives to some of the more common vegetables you may be used to eating. Succulents like prickly pear or dolnamul can turn barren land with very little fertility into an oasis of fresh food. Plants that generate a lot of biomass like udo can offer us regular harvests while producing organic matter for mulching. Weedy annuals like perilla can compete with grass and turn unproductive land into a thicket of food in a single season. The options are truly limitless, and every plant has its own unique traits that can be utilized to our advantage.</p><p>The food we choose to grow is also fundamentally related to how we eat. If we only eat a few times per day, each meal needs to be extremely calorically dense, further deepening our reliance on grains. But what if we ate more like the guerilla? It's a lot easier to eat five pounds of fruit over the course of an entire day than it is to eat it at only three meals. Maybe changing what we eat also means changing how we eat.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Working With Nature</h2><p>The methods I use all fit into a singular holistic approach - working with natural systems to incorporate food crops into the landscape. The plants are our teachers. This mean learning from them without any preconceived notions about how they should grow or what they should be doing. We are watching and listening, not expecting. It is absolutely essential that we approach this with a sense of humility, respect, and the recognition that plants are complex and intelligent living beings. We will never understand the endless layers of nuance that guide their growth, but lucky for us we don't need to. All we need to do is listen closely and offer our service.</p><p>Healthy soil is the backbone of temperate food forests, and plants are natural soil builders. Plants build soil using a few primary methods. Sending roots into the soil adds organic matter, cycles nutrients, aerates the soil and gives it structure. This builds soil from within. After the plants die, their stems and leaves fall over and act as mulch until they fully decompose. Dead plants keep the soil from drying out, return nutrients to the topsoil and offer a sheltered microclimate for everything happening at ground level. This builds soil from above. And the way plants naturally die and return to the ground creates a thick but not overly dense layer of mulch. Most importantly, it has structure. It allows space for other seeds to germinate and grow while still offering shelter from the elements. When one plant dies it creates the right environment for the next plant to take its spot, to work the soil with its roots, and then to become mulch for the next plant. This is the genius of nature. </p><p>So our two most important methods of building soil are using the power of roots to work the soil, and returning organic matter back to the topsoil as mulch. In the garden we can imitate these patterns by letting plants cover as much ground as possible. The more roots we have working the soil for us, the better. Of course, we can't let every single plant grow to maturity or else there would be no room for our food crops. This is where we come in. We can curate which plants to let grow and which to cut down. Instead of ripping everything up and dumping an even mat of mulch on our beds, we can build the soil more naturally. By cutting down plants in the garden and using them as mulch, we are imitating a natural soil-building pattern.</p><p>Encouraging plants to cover the soil and continuously decompose has added benefits as well. First, it creates the right environment for insects. Bugs need a diverse landscape with a variety of physical niches to take advantage of. They don't like flat sheets of mulch. If we didn't have the right balance of insects, we would constantly be fighting against them. This method of management invites them all in to sort it out amongst themselves. The insects can then become our partners as primary decomposers of dead plants, continuously adding fertility to the soil. Second, it creates the right environment for beneficial fungal networks. Plants depend on fungi to survive and thrive. The more roots they can partner with and the more organic matter we can feed them, the better. </p><p>Practically, implementing this system is fairly straightforward because we are letting nature do most of the work for us. There will be a host of plants growing in our garden beds whether we like or not. If any plants are competing too much with our food crops, we just cut them down and let them fall where they are. The more aggressive the species is the more often those plants will need to be removed. If we let them grow they may create too much shade or spread too aggressively. But the species that present little competition to our food crops need less management. Some of them may be edible themselves, some may attract beneficial insects, some may fix nitrogen, some may protect the soil. We are looking at the ground and seeing which plants are working for us and which ones aren't. Those that aren't get ripped up and now they are working for us as mulch! </p><p>As an example, in my garden beds I allow many plants to grow, some of which are: <i>Duchesnea indica [mock strawberry] </i>acts as a non-invasive groundcover;<i> Trifolium repens [white clover] </i>and any other leguminous plants fix nitrogen; <i>Lobelia inflata [Indian tobacco] </i>is a native medicinal; <i>Stellaria media [chickweed]</i> is a delicous edible; <i>Zinnia peruviana [Peruvian zinnia] </i>is a beautiful flower appreciated by local pollinators. There are also many that I rip up and mulch in place with as often as possible: <i>Muhlenbergia schreberi [nimblewill]</i> or any other weedy grasses spread quickly by rhizome and discourage vegetable seed germination; <i>Erechtites hieraciifolius [American burnweed], Acalypha rhomboidea [copperleaf], </i>and<i> Persicaria maculosa [lady's thumb] </i>all multiply rapidly by seed and can easily take over garden beds. It is always helpful to watch how a plant interacts with the its environment before running to rip it up. Natural processes are constantly working towards a healthier ecosystem and are ultimately doing the vast majority of work for us. Our role is not to redefine these processes, but use them to help guide the environment towards productivity and diversity. </p><p>This system works particularly well for beds with annuals and biennials that rely on seed dispersal for their continued survival. A thick layer of mulch would lock in moisture but prevent the dispersed seeds from germinating. A thin layer of mulch would allow the seeds to germinate but dry the soil out. But mulching in place with native plants creates a structured mulch that is thick enough to lock in moisture but open and aerated enough for germinating seeds to grow. This system also allows us to work within a sustainable, closed loop. We are not depending on mulch or soil delivered from somewhere else, everything we need is being grown right on our own land. We are not importing fertility, we are building it.</p><p>In addition to building soil naturally, we can also imitate how plants naturally disperse seed. Direct seeding right into the ground is effective and produces high germination rates, but there are drawbacks. If all the seedlings germinate at roughly the same time, they are all subject to identical conditions during identical phases of growth. If a dry spell occurs right after germination and the seedlings are not drought tolerant enough, they will all die unless they are watered. Or slugs may come through and eat them. Or a heavy downpour may damage them. Or it may be too sunny and they'll get scorched. Any number of things could happen to affect them. Essentially, by forcing them to grow in a certain place at a certain time, the whole population is now entirely dependent on you. But when seeds are naturally dispersed through whatever mechanism the plant uses, they tend to grow in slightly different circumstances. Many will not germinate at all, some will sit on a leaf until being knocked over a few months later, some will get moved around by the birds. Some will germinate and die because of the weather or because they landed in the wrong niche. Only a small percentage of them will grow to maturity - this is natural, and this is why plants produce so many seeds (hundreds or thousands). But even though the rate of germination is much lower, the resiliency of that population is much higher. So whenever possible we are imitating the natural dispersal of seeds and encouraging them to germinate intermittently in different conditions. This can be as simple as letting seeds drop of their own accord, but for the best results it often means spreading them around the garden beds where we think they will grow well. Lucky for them we have legs! We can move their seeds around farther than they can, and I'm sure they would thank us for this if they could. Seeds can be left in their pods and dropped right on top of any mulch or garden debris. For most annuals or biennials, the pattern is fairly similar: help the plant propagate itself without getting in the way. We are giving power back to the seeds by letting them decide when to germinate and how to grow - our job is only to create the right environment for them to do it. </p><p>For annuals or biennials this method requires a lot of seed. A single plant can produce thousands of seeds, but in any given season less than a dozen may grow to maturity (this will vary based on the plant and how favorable the local environment is). Unfortunately, most seed packets come with comparatively few seeds. So our first generation should be grown in more carefully managed conditions and cared for until they go to seed. This will get the plant acquainted with our local conditions while increasing our seed count to something more realistic. Once we have have hundreds or thousands of fresh seeds, these can then be dispersed more naturally into the garden beds and allowed to grow on their own. The soil is now functioning as our seed bank - every year we are depositing more and more seeds into it that will then wait for the right opportunity to germinate and grow. With every successive generation, the plants will be better acclimated to this specific method and will grow more easily. And as the amount of seeds in the soil increases, we can spend less time weeding because our food crops will be able to compete better and cover more ground.  </p><p>We must remember that seeds and plants are intelligent, responsive living beings. They understand the particulars of every patch of soil. They understand the nuances of weather. In many ways they are much smarter than us. With my human eyes and hands I can only know so much about the soil. If one of us has to decide where and when to grow, it should be them. As a human I do, of course, have certain strengths: weeding, mulching, loosening and building soil, dispersing seed. My arms help create a favorable environment for the crops, and my legs help disperse their seed in the right spot. But I don't bother trying to control their growth because this is what they are good at and I would only be getting in their way! It is a beautiful thing to partner with a plant. Honor that relationship and only good things can come. </p><p>Even with all the help we provide, some plants will simply not be suited for our soil or climate without a lot of work. So it's just as important to find the right species for our specific conditions. We can't expect to drop any old plant in and have it grow! This is why our plant selection prioritizes resiliency, and those that do survive become become stronger with every generation. Before long the food will be growing itself. Of course, regular maintenance is unavoidable. In order to grow certain plants we must halt the process of succession - otherwise our garden would quickly become a deciduous forest (at least where I live). Incorporating tree crops helps us work with succession to a certain degree, but ultimately there is no way to avoid the basic work of weeding, transplanting and dispersing seeds. Every garden requires maintenance, but this method allows us to use natural processes to our advantage and intervene only when it is meaningful. This is not a step by step plan with a full proof outcome. This is a dance.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Rewilding Vegetables</h2><p>All of the vegetables we grow in the garden were once plants growing the wild, surviving on their own without any help from humans. They drank only rain water and took what nutrients they needed from the soil. They produced seed which then went on to germinate and grow of its own accord, again without any help from humans. So why must gardening be so complicated? Why do we struggle to grow plants that often grow prolifically and behave as weeds when left alone in their natural habitat? Here are three perspectives to approach this from:</p><p><br></p><p><b>Breeding:</b> Most annuals and biennials have been bred for hundreds or thousands of years, and they are no longer adapted to thrive in the face of intense competition and scarce natural resources. Generations of selection have weakened many of their natural defenses against competition, disease and predation. </p><blockquote><i>Approach: Select for specimens that can thrive with little care and let go of those that cannot. This will lead to a resilient population capable of propagating itself.</i></blockquote><p><br></p><p><b>Environment:</b> Plants evolve alongside their environment, carving out unique niches in which they can successfully grow and propagate themselves. We can move a plant from the wilderness to our gardens, but we cannot move the landscape, climate, wildlife and the endless number of other, unknown variables.</p><blockquote><i>Approach: Acclimate crops to a new environment by creating favorable conditions and weeding selectively. As the plants evolve, so should your management practices.</i></blockquote><p><br></p><p><b>Density:</b> Even when a crop has been bred for resiliency and is well-adapted to our local environment, we are usually still attempting to grow it at a much higher density than would naturally be the case. Healthy soil that can support our crops depends on a diversity of plants in constant evolution with one another. </p><blockquote><i>Approach: Grow a diverse variety of crops alongside each other to lower the density of any given species, keep soil healthy, and encourage a balanced insect population.</i></blockquote><p><br></p><p>This three-pronged approach helps me understand the vegetables I grow in a broader context and offers a simple framework for growing crops in a way that becomes both easier and more sustainable over time.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Management Patterns</h2><p>I am always trying to get as close to natural patterns as I can - the less I have to intervene, the better. Of course, the ideal form of natural farming may not always be as practical, especially if a certain level of production is required within a specific timeframe. Below I have laid out some of the defining characteristics of two different management patterns. Both would, of course, be considered natural farming but they differ in many important ways.</p><p><br></p><table tableid="066664da" columns="2" style="--columns: 2; --rows: 14;" rows="14" class=""><tr><td class=""><b>Fluid </b></td><td class=""><b>Rigid</b></td></tr><tr><td class=""><i>Human management integrating with natural patterns.</i></td><td class=""><i>Human management interfering with natural patterns.</i></td></tr><tr><td class="">Crop growth and soil regeneration occur simultaneously.</td><td class="">Crop growth and soil regeneration occur separately. </td></tr><tr><td class="">Crops selected based on local conditions.</td><td class="">Crops selected based on human preference.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Weeds grow alongside vegetables.</td><td class="">Weeds mainly grow during fallow periods.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Competitive weeds are mulched in place.</td><td class="">All weeds are mulched in place or composted.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Beds are never cleared or reset.</td><td class="">Beds are cleared and reset before every planting.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Fluid and natural crop rotation.</td><td class="">Rigid and scheduled crop rotation.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Seeds are stored alongside each other in the soil.</td><td class="">Seeds are collected, cleaned, and stored separately.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Seeds are dispersed naturally as they appear.</td><td class="">Seeds are sown before expected germination.</td></tr><tr><td class="">No control over when crops germinate and grow.</td><td class="">Control over when crops germinate and grow.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Polycultures are formed spontaneously.</td><td class="">Polycultures are intentionally organized.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Vegetables are harvested as they are needed.</td><td class="">Vegetables are harvested all at once.</td></tr><tr><td class="">Perennials grow alongside annuals.</td><td class="">Perennials mainly grow separate from annuals.</td></tr></table><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Grass → Garden</h2><p>This is a rough and generalized process for converting areas overtaken by native grasses and plants into usable garden beds. This is not meant to be used for larger areas or fields - these usually need to be cleared and reseeded with the right equipment, or slowly transformed over a much longer period of time. </p><p><br></p><ul><li>1.

But if grasses or other native plants are not removed in any way, different methods are needed. Slowly transforming the space by transplanting larger perennials, especially trees and shrubs, is your best bet. I am also experimenting with crops like kenaf and barley that can be direct seeded into compacted soil and succeed even with heavy competition from grasses.</p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Methods</h2><p>The methods we use to grow, maintain, harvest and propagate crops can make all the difference in both the health of the ecosystem and how much work it requires to maintain. These are the basic principles I use in my garden.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Feed the soil. </b>Focus on crops that feed the soil. Plants like <i>Aralia cordata [udo]</i> and <i>Canna edulis [achira]</i> generate large amounts of top growth for mulching. Plants like <i>Raphanus sativus [radish]</i> and <i>Brassica rapa [turnip]</i> have fat roots that aerate the soil and feed beneficial bacteria when they decompose. Plants like <i>Elaeagnus multiflora [goumi]</i> and <i>Phaseolus coccineus [runner bean]</i> fix nitrogen in the soil and keep it productive. </p><p><b>Build structure.</b> Loose soil gets compacted and washed away with heavy rains. Healthy soil has structure that improves drainage, aeration and water retention, all while holding it together and preventing erosion. Roots build structure within the soil, while mulching in place builds structure above the soil. Tilling is avoided because it destroys soil structure and the fungal networks that depend on it. </p><p><b>Weed selectively.</b> Native plants growing in our beds can serve important functions. Many are edible themselves, help protect the soil, fix nitrogen or attract beneficial insects. Any plants that offer little function or compete with our food crops are ripped up and mulched in place.</p><p><b>Disperse seeds naturally.</b> Seeds should be dispersed on top of mulch and in their pods if they have any. Naturally dispersed seeds land in slightly different niches and germinate intermittently. This improves the resiliency of the population in the face of unpredictable weather patterns and pressure from disease or insects. This also allows the soil to function as our seed bank, holding large quantities of seed until they are ready to grow. </p><p><b>Annuals alongside perennials. </b>Perennials offer stability and reliable production. These can be transplanted, a small amount of work for many years of food. Annuals have a different niche altogether and should be treated as such. They love taking advantage of disturbed soil and quickly filling in empty spaces between our perennials. Their seeds should be dispersed across the garden beds so they can spring into action when an opportunity presents itself.</p><p><b>Roots alongside roots. </b>Roots are an important source of energy, but many require deep soil disturbance to harvest. These should be primarily grown alongside other complementary root crops. This makes harvesting easier, ensures we don't damage nearby perennials, and limits the impact on soil structure. </p><p><b>Harvesting is selecting.</b> Harvesting the weakest plants allows the population to become stronger and better adapted to local conditions with every generation. Our first priority is not a big harvest, but plants with resilient and productive genetics.</p><p><b>Use local materials.</b> Most gardeners have access to natural materials like branches, leaves or grass clippings from adjacent land or the local community. A thick layer of leaves can be great for beds with primarily root crops or perennials. In beds where seed germination is a priority, I prefer grass clippings and small branches.</p><p><b>Collect rain water. </b>Harvest as much rainwater as possible to reduce reliance on unsustainable sources of water. If plants can't be grown with locally available water, you might want to think twice about growing them at all. If you already have a gutter system, all you need to do is a purchase a few parts <a href="https://www.rainbrothers.com/store/DIY-Rain-Barrel-Kit-c73647286" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> and hook them up to a large barrel (or trash can). The system is easy to expand as well.</p><p><br></p><p>The methods I use won't give you beds full of vegetables right away, and at first it may feel like nothing is working. This is totally normal! No amount of upfront work will change the fact that it takes time and persistence to learn how to care for plants. The first few years are always the hardest, but as time goes on it will get so much easier and so much more productive. If you trust the soil-building techniques and continue offering your service to the multitude of creatures that reside in your garden, then it is inevitable you will see improvements. I spend a lot of time on this stuff and still kill so many plants. Things are going wrong more often than not! Haha. Be patient.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Animal Interactions</h2><p>The right plant design will serve not only us humans but all of the creatures that live with us. Non-human animals have different dietary requirements than we do and the way they interact with many plants also poses unique challenges. Taking these considerations into account is essential for creating a space we can comfortably share with our non-human brothers and sisters. In the plant list further down I do my best to indicate crops commonly fed to animals, although the information available for many plants is very limited.</p><p><br></p><h3>Sensitive Plants</h3><p>Half the battle of growing and designing for animals is that they will often eat anything you plant before it's had time to reach maturity! Protecting our plants from grazing or uprooting is the first priority, and there are a few different ways to approach this. Knowing what animals you are protecting against will make life much easier, but in reality it often takes many failed attempts to figure this out.</p><p><b>Fencing: </b>The easiest way to prevent sensitive plants from being eaten, dug up or damaged is to enclose them behind a fence. If the enclosed area is large enough for a deer to jump into, the fence should be roughly 7 feet high. When designing our garden, it can be helpful to keep in mind that deer don't like narrow, enclosed spaces. Even when fencing is not used, this principle can still help discourage deer from browsing in certain areas. If the enclosed area is narrow enough that deer can't or won't jump inside, the fence only need to be high enough to prevent any animals from reaching their head over the fence and eating the plants within. Exactly how high this is depends on how tall the the plants within the fence are. If animals or rodents digging underneath the fence is a concern, use a fence with a finer mesh and bury the bottom of it 6-12 inches in the soil. See <a href="https://www.starkbros.com/growing-guide/article/keeping-deer-off-your-fruit-trees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> for a simple fencing setup.</p><p><b>Height:</b> Plants that are high in the air can't get eaten! This mainly applies to trees and vines, both of which can also provide shelter or shade for animals underneath. Both still need to be protected when young, but once tall enough they will be safe from browsing. Keep in mind that even if a tree is tall enough to avoid or tolerate most browsing, it may still benefit from a fence to deter buck rubbing. This is when male deer rub their bucks against young trees to help speed up the velvet shedding process. Some form of protection may also still be required around the lower trunk of the tree to prevent rodents from chewing off the bark. This can be accomplished by loosely wrapping plastic or metal fencing around the trunk. Ideally the fencing will extend a few inches into the soil and still allow the bark to to receive both sunlight and airflow. </p><p><b>Cover:</b> Covering the soil with logs or stones can help prevent pigs, chickens or rodents from digging up plant roots. This is especially useful for tubers or root crops, but may also be useful for any trees, shrubs or plants with shallow root systems. It's as easy as covering the soil surrounding the plants with natural, heavy materials that won't get moved around easily. If you'd like to give the animals access to the plants once they've started producing, just remove some of the cover and let the animals find their way over.</p><p><b>Diversity: </b>A clean layer of mulch and easy-to-spot vegetables are practically an invitation for deer, rabbits or any other animals. Common wisdom dictates that planting herbs with pungent odors alongside your vegetables will help deter browsing. From personal experience I can tell you this doesn't really work in a microcosm. But having a densely planted bed with a variety of herbs, vegetables and weeds all growing on top of one another can actually help deter browsing to a certain degree. The key is to have the appetizing plants tucked in between a variety of non-appetizing plants with no discernible pattern. </p><p><br></p><h3>Resistant Plants</h3><p>Plants that are appetizing to wildlife can be protected using the methods above, but what about all the plants they aren't interested in eating? I can say with certainty it is possible to grow a garden filled with a diverse array of wildlife-resistant food plants, we just have to think outside the box. Having deer in the neighborhood is no longer an excuse!</p><p><b>Timing.</b> Some plants may only be eaten by wildlife during specific phases of growth or specific times of the year. <i>Hosta spp. [hosta]</i> plants are generally only eaten once they begin to leaf out. Because of this the shoots can still be harvested without any problems. <i>Hemerocallis spp. [daylily]</i> plants produce new flowers every day during certain portions of the year. The flowers are eaten by deer but the leaves of the plants never are. So the plants stay healthy and with some prudence I can often harvest the flowers before the deer get them. Some other plants are not preferred browse during the growing season but will get eaten in times of scarcity (typically during the winter). In my garden this includes <i>Brassica oleracea [kale]</i>. In these cases I don't mind sharing as I can still harvest the plants for most of the year.</p><p><b>Taste.</b> Plants with pungent aromas or flavors are often left alone by wildlife. This includes some of my favorite herbs like <i>Agastache rugosa [Korean mint]</i>, <i>Pycnanthemum incanum [mountain mint]</i> and many others. It also includes many beloved vegetables! <i>Brassica rapa</i> <i>[turnip] </i>and other mustards are often resistant to browsing due to their off-putting flavor. <i>Perilla frutescens [perilla] </i>is also left alone by deer for this reason (but grow it with care as the plant is toxic to cows, goats and some other animals). <i>Oxalis tuberosa [oca]</i> is similarly avoided due to the extremely sour stems and leaves caused by high levels of oxalic acid.</p><p><b>Danger.</b> Many plants contain natural defenses to being eaten. The most obvious examples include those with spines, like some forms of <i>Opuntia humifusa [prickly pear]</i>, or those with stinging hairs, like <i>Urtica dioica [stinging nettle]</i>. It also includes plants which contain high levels of irritating calcium oxalate like <i>Colocasia esculenta [taro]</i>. We can prepare these plants to make them safe to eat but animals typically avoid them. And don't forget the many woody, thorny plants like <i>Aralia elata [angelica tree]</i> and <i>Rubus idaeus [raspberry]</i>.</p><p><br></p><p>These considerations may help prevent some animals or wildlife from eating your crops, but at the end of the day we can only do so much. Deer will often eat plants you would never expect them to. Squirrels can climb your trees and birds can fly just about anywhere, so without covering your entire garden in a net there is no way to avoid everything. Designing an ecosystem where animal life is balanced with plant life is the ideal, but that is the work of many lifetimes. So I just try to be grateful that those who visit my garden are able to appreciate the food I spent so much time growing. We have taken so much from them already, it is the least I can do.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>What would it mean for us to come to terms with the knowledge that civilization, our whole mode of development and culture, has been premised and built upon extermination—on a history experienced as "terror without end" (to borrow a phrase from Adorno)? To dwell on such a thought would be to throw into almost unbearable relief the distance between our narratives of inherent human dignity and grace and moral superiority, on the one hand, and the most elemental facts of our actual social existence, on the other. </i></p><p><i>We congratulate ourselves for our social progress—for democratic governance and state-protected civil and human rights (however notional or incompletely defended)—yet continue to enslave and kill millions of sensitive creatures who in many biological, hence emotional and cognitive particulars resemble us.

"For the principles of Humanity cannot be renounced with impunity; but their renunciation, if persisted in, involves inevitably the forfeiture of humanity itself. And to cease through such forfeiture man is to become demon."

Calories may not be the best symbol of how our food sustains us, but it's an easy way to compare crops. These tables are a work in progress and I am still discovering what the expected yields should be.</p><p>The tables below include selected crops with available nutritional information, a rough estimate of their caloric value, and possible yields per plants based on decent growing conditions in my climate. I like to think about energy per plant because that is how I tend to break things down in my head, but this does not take into account time or space. All of these plants require the full growing season to maximize yields except for garlic and potatoes which generally only need half that.</p><p><br></p><h3>Roots</h3><table tableid="1e57db51" columns="4" style="--columns: 4; --rows: 17;" rows="17" class=""><tr><td class=""><b>Crop</b></td><td class=""><b>Calories/Pound</b></td><td class=""><b>Pounds/Plant</b></td><td class=""><b>Calories/Plant</b></td></tr><tr><td class="">Achira</td><td class="">370</td><td class="">6</td><td class="">2220</td></tr><tr><td class="">Sunchoke</td><td class="">330</td><td class="">5 [?]</td><td class="">1650 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Mashua</td><td class="">310</td><td class="">4 [?]</td><td class="">1240 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Taro</td><td class="">500</td><td class="">2 [?]</td><td class="">1000 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Sweet Potato</td><td class="">380</td><td class="">2</td><td class="">760 </td></tr><tr><td class="">Potato</td><td class="">350</td><td class="">2</td><td class="">700</td></tr><tr><td class="">Oca</td><td class="">330</td><td class="">1</td><td class="">330</td></tr><tr><td class="">Leek</td><td class="">270</td><td class="">1 [?]</td><td class="">270 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Burdock</td><td class="">400</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">200 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Parsnip</td><td class="">340</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">170 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Garlic</td><td class="">670</td><td class="">0.2 [?]</td><td class="">130 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Salsify</td><td class="">370</td><td class="">0.2 [?]</td><td class="">70 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Radish</td><td class="">70</td><td class="">1 [?]</td><td class="">70 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Carrot</td><td class="">190</td><td class="">0.3 [?]</td><td class="">60 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Turnip</td><td class="">120</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">60 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Bunching Onion</td><td class="">150</td><td class="">0.3 [?]</td><td class="">40 [?]</td></tr></table><p><br></p><h3>Seed</h3><table tableid="9bb47cc3" columns="4" style="--columns: 4; --rows: 8;" rows="8" class=""><tr><td class=""><b>Crop</b></td><td class=""><b>Calories/Pound</b></td><td class=""><b>Pounds/Plant</b></td><td class=""><b>Calories/Plant</b></td></tr><tr><td class="">Amaranth</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">750 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Sorghum</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">750 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Maize</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">750 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Quinoa</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.5 [?]</td><td class="">750 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Sunflower</td><td class="">2600</td><td class="">0.2 [?]</td><td class="">520 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Runner Bean</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.2 [?]</td><td class="">300 [?]</td></tr><tr><td class="">Barley</td><td class="">1500</td><td class="">0.01 [?]</td><td class="">15 [?]</td></tr></table><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Favorite Crops 🖤</h2><p>These are the crops I believe can form the foundation of a resilient and productive garden.

I find polycultures most useful for root crops as they often require regular or deep soil disturbance and replanting, whereas many other vegetables and herbs can often grow alongside each other without much trouble.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Three Sisters: Amaranth + Runner Bean + Squash </b></p><p><i>Moderate Soil / Sun / </i><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/2p77a274mcf5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>Illustrations &amp; Photos</i></a></p><p>A classic formula with some new faces. The amaranth and squash should be transplanted and the runner bean can be direct seeded. This will give the amaranth a head start so it is tall enough to support the nitrogen-fixing beans. Transplanting also means we don't have to worry as much about weeds. The squash grows along the ground, covering soil and holding in moisture. Amaranth leaves and runner beans are harvested as needed. Amaranth seed and squash are harvested at the end of the growing season. Amaranth stalks can be mulched in place after seeds are harvested. Amaranth can be replaced with any other tall, seed-producing plant if desired.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Large Annual Roots: Achira + Taro + Mashua</b></p><p><i>Moist &amp; Rich Soil / Sun / </i><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/obdu7mqck7t2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>Illustrations &amp; Photos</i></a></p><p>This is a prime time polyculture with three productive root crops. I use it in the best spot in the garden that stays moist year round and gets lots of sun. The achira gets tall enough to provide some shade and shelter for the others, while the mashua is allowed to sprawl on the ground and climb around. Harvest when they've all died back, and either replant immediately with a thick layer of mulch or bring indoors to overwinter if necessary. Produces a lot of mulch that can be applied back to the same spot once harvested. </p><p><br></p><p><b>Small Annual Roots: Potato + Oca + Leek</b></p><p><i>Moderate &amp; Loose Soil / Sun / </i><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/ta4m26eeaidt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>Illustrations &amp; Photos</i></a></p><p>Designed for low-till cultivation in which the potato and oca are harvested and replanted all at once in the fall. The potatoes die back well before the first frost and wait in the ground until the oca dies back. At this point everything gets harvested. Leeks can be replaced with walking or bunching onions as an easier alternative. Nasturtium can also be incorporated to clamber around as it only picks up speed once the potatoes die back. </p><p><br></p><p><b>Perennial Roots: Marshmallow + Doraji + Groundnut </b></p><p><i>Moderate Soil / Shade To Sun / </i><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/svijuvltnjqi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>Illustrations &amp; Photos</i></a></p><p>A productive choice for partial shade. Both doraji and marshmallow are easily grown taproots, the latter growing much taller. Works best when the marshmallow is planted from a large division so it grows tall enough the first year to support the nitrogen-fixing groundnut. Other perennial roots like ladybell, deodeok, king's spear or salsify can be incorporated alongside doraji. All harvested every 2nd or 3rd year and divisions are replanted. </p><p><br></p><p><b>Competitive Roots: Sunchoke + Chinese Yam </b></p><p><i>Moderate &amp; Loose Soil / Sun / </i><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/vpc7be404sth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>Illustrations &amp; Photos</i></a></p><p>I like growing these together because they are both very competitive and can be difficult to remove once established. I plant them in a spot that is easy to manage where neither can escape. Sunchoke is the heavy-yielding star of the show and the trellis for the chinese yam. The yam should be planted in buried drainage pipes or grow bags in between the sunchoke. This allows us to harvest the sunchoke every year without disturbing the yam, and makes harvesting the yam every 2nd or 3rd year much easier. Chinese bugleweed can also be incorporated to fill in the gaps around the others.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Competitive Annuals: Kenaf + Perilla  </b></p><p><i>Poor Or Compacted Soil / Sun / </i><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/ke8evn0lkob3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>Illustrations &amp; Photos</i></a></p><p>This pairing was designed to be direct seeded into grasses or weeds, shading them out while building soil and generating mulch. Perilla usually forms dense patches and shades out other plants, but kenaf grows so strong and tall it can shoot right through it. Perilla is also tolerant of the shade kenaf creates. Leave of both are harvested as needed, and the kenaf stalks can be harvested when the plant dies. Perilla will reseed itself if you let it but kenaf should be direct seeded. </p><p><br></p><p><b>Regenerative Annuals: Barley + Turnip + Radish</b></p><p><i>Poor Or Compacted Soil / Sun / </i><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/3n6aakdqibma" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>Illustrations &amp; Photos</i></a></p><p>An excellent polyculture for building soil and growing food at the same time! Turnips and radishes are some of my favorite plants, their large roots help concentrate sugars and aerate soil. Barley generates some mulch without creating too much shade for the others. Harvest the barley once the seeds dry and mulch in place with the stalks. Turnips and radishes can be harvested as needed but the more you leave to flower the better your soil will be.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Regenerative Perennials: Japanese Mugwort + Alpine Dock + Comfrey</b></p><p><i>Poor Or Compacted Soil / Shade To Sun / </i><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/jf0fr06mlec6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>Illustrations &amp; Photos</i></a></p><p>These are some of my favorite perennial soil regeneration plants. If you are starting a garden and want to invest in building your soil then this is an excellent choice. Mugwort shoots and young dock leaves can be harvested for food while all three can be used for mulch as needed.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Succulents: Prickly Pear + Dolnamul </b></p><p><i>Poor Or Well-Draining Soil / Sun / </i><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/k9254vv441bf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>Illustrations &amp; Photos</i></a></p><p>A basic pairing, both vegetables thriving in similar conditions, dolanmul acting as a groundcover for prickly pear. The only issue is that prickly pear has glochids, so I would avoid harvesting the dolnamul directly next to the cactus pads just in case they got knocked off. You do not want to eat a glochid! Harvest both as needed.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Fruits &amp; Veggies: Fruit Tree + Hosta + Daylily + Gomchwi + Mitsuba</b></p><p><i>Moderate Soil / Sun / </i><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/lnrmhqqnf27a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i>Illustrations &amp; Photos</i></a></p><p>This group came about because I wanted a selection of perennial vegetables that could grow underneath a small/medium sized fruit tree. These vegetables are all low-growing and don't mind sun when the tree is young or shade once the tree matures. The daylily should be any edible variety except for the common orange ditch lily, as this one will quickly outcompete the other vegetables. </p><p><br></p><p>Crops propagated by their root like achira, taro, mashua, potato and sunchoke should ideally have multiple varieties. Crops that can be propagated by either division or seed, like marshmallow and doraji, can be divided but should regularly be grown from seed as well to maintain genetic diversity. Even if a polyculture is growing in the same bed from year to year, it is often best to rotate the plants around so they are not growing in exactly the same spot.</p><p>These polycultures are not self-sustaining and should be regularly fed/mulched, especially if they are growing in the same bed from year to year. Beans, peas or clover can be incorporated for nitrogen. Plants that draw pollinators may also be helpful to control pests. Think of these polycultures as building blocks that interact with and depend on the diversity of the rest of the garden. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>Man, do not pride yourself on your superiority to the animals, for they are without sin, while you, with all your greatness, you defile the earth wherever you appear and leave an ignoble trail behind you -- and that is true, alas, for almost every one of us!</i></p><p><i>-Fyodor Dostoyevsky</i></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Guide</h2><p><b>Annual/Perennial: </b>Designations for zone 7a, may differ in other climates. I typically try to use the most common English name for the plant, although the Latin name is always the most accurate. I also sometimes include the name of the plant in the most relevant language to help with personal research.</p><p><b>Edible:</b> Useful edible parts. Not comprehensive, not a reference, only a starting point. Often there will be more edible portions than indicated, but I may not mention them for any number of reasons. Do not eat anything you are not 100% familiar with. Always be certain of your identification and the parts edible. Consult multiple sources, see resources at the end of page. </p><p>I do not always indicate whether a plant can be eaten raw or must be cooked. Some plants cannot be eaten raw but can be cooked or prepared in some other way, such as drying or fermenting. Processes like fermenting will sometimes render a food safe to eat in the same way that cooking would. But it is not always this simple. Many plants must be prepared in a specific way in order to make them safe to eat. <i>Petasites Japonicus</i>, for example, should always be both blanched and peeled prior to eating. Or consider <i>Rheum Acuminatum</i>, a little-known species of rhubarb. It is usually dried and pickled before being eaten. Does this mean it cannot just be cooked like other species of rhubarb? It may be totally harmless, or maybe the drying and fermenting accomplishes something that cooking does not, something we are not aware of. Tradition is wise, but it rarely explains itself. And even if it was harmful, the effects are unlikely to be obvious. Some plants can quietly build up toxins in your body for decades before manifesting themselves as symptoms of an illness. So just because a plant can be eaten without any noticeable adverse effects does not mean that it is safe to eat regularly over a longer period of time. This is why it is important to understand the history of how foods are prepared and eaten. After that, if you want to experiment then the risk is yours to take. But as far as this reference goes, I try to stay conservative. </p><p><u>Root:</u> Plants that store energy in roots or tubers usually draw on this energy to produce flowering shoots. Perennial roots are therefore usually harvested after the plant has flowered and been given ample time to store more energy in the roots. This may be at the end of the growing season or it may be earlier. Annual or biennial roots are harvested before flowering as in this case it signifies the end of the plant's life. To maximize harvests we can dig up the root after it's done most of its growing but before it has a chance to start producing a flowering shoot. After flowering occurs the root will be tough and inedible. However, whether annual or perennial the best practices for harvesting will depend on the specific plant and growing conditions.</p><p><u>Shoot:</u> Shoot refers only to the young growth of the plant when it first emerges from the ground; in other words, the entire aerial portion of the young plant, often in spring. This is <i>not</i> the same as terminal or tender new growth (see below). How large the young plant is when harvested depends on the specific plant. Just because a shoot is edible does not indicate that any part of the mature plants is edible. If a plant contains harmful or toxic substances, these may be in low enough quantities when the plant is young but not when it matures. If the mature leaves of a plant are edible then usually so is the shoot, but depending on the plant I may not write this if it is not normally eaten that way (as in the case with many herbs). Shoots are valued for their sweet flavor and tender texture, especially when the mature plant may be bitter or tough. They are therefore often the preferred harvest of a plant.</p><p><u>Stem &amp; Leaf:</u> If the leaf is edible then usually so is the terminal or tender new growth, harvested with some of the new stem. In fact, when the leaves are small, young or tightly bunched this can often be the best time to harvest. I only indicate separately that the stem is edible when it constitutes a meaningful portion of the edible harvest or when it can be eaten even when relatively mature. For example, amaranth or nettle are often eaten with some of the tender stem, but I only write the leaf is edible because the stem is relatively insignificant to the harvest. However, when water spinach, angelica, udo and many others are harvested, the stem is cut further down and constitutes a significant part of the vegetable, therefore it is included in the edible portions. Of course this is not always a clear line as it varies between plants and how you choose to harvest or prepare them.</p><p><u>Inflorescence + Flower:</u> Flowering shoots are a separate identification and are indicated as inflorescence. These are eaten when still young, clustered, and tender. If the inflorescence is edible then often so are the flower buds and flowers, although this may not always be practical or palatable. There are roughly three stages for harvest: entire young inflorescence while still tender, sometimes with some of the tender stem attached; the individual, unopened flower buds picked off once the flowering stem becomes tougher; the blooming flowers when fully or partially open. Some plants are only eaten during one stage, while some can be eaten during all three. Once a plant begins to form a flowering shoot, the leaves usually become more bitter and tough as energy is being drawn away to support the flowers. Plants with leaves that do not become bitter during flowering are often valued for this trait. </p><p><u>Seed:</u> I will occasionally indicate the seed is edible if it is useful in some way. Just because a flower is edible does not mean the seed is, and vice versa.</p><p>Some of the plants are marked as calorie crops. This is to indicate they are efficient producers of calories given one season and a limited amount of space. This is almost entirely root and seed crops. It does not include many other useful and potential staple crops that take longer to grow or are not as efficient.</p><p>The best way to know how to eat a plant is to do research, grow it and become familiar with it. Even with references, the actual details of how it's harvested and eaten can vary between plants. And keep in mind that many online references are just summarizing (often poorly or incorrectly) physical reference books that provide more detail. If a plant is uncommon, then especially thorough research is required. Typically we are looking to answer a few basic questions. Is there an extensive history of humans eating this part of the plant? If so, how is it prepared and in what quantity is it eaten? Are there any indications that this plant may contain harmful or toxic substances? The more information you have, the better.<i>  </i></p><blockquote><i>Always remember the golden rule: if it's not regularly eaten, don't eat it regularly. </i></blockquote><p>Just because one species in a genus is edible does not mean that other species are. And just because one part of the plant is edible does not mean that others parts are. These kinds of assumptions will put you in the hospital or in the ground. There are even cases, as with some members of the <i>Calystegia </i>genus, where one variety of a species is edible but another variety within the very same species is not. Therefore we must be thoughtful about what exactly we are eating and recognize that academic taxonomy has its limits. Even if an online resource says something is edible (including this one), you must do your own research!</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Useful methods of propagation. Usually seed, stem cutting, or rhizome/tuber/root division. Seeds that prefer cold stratification or sunlight to germinate are often noted as such. I sometimes try to get bare roots or potted plants if a seed is difficult to germinate.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Rough guidelines for minimum sun requirements: Sun (≈90-100%) → Part Shade (≈60-90%) → Shade (≈30-60%) → Deep shade (≈0-30%). Estimating sun is difficult, but I do my best to give rough guidelines. Most of the time, if a plant prefers shade, it will also prefer rich and moist soil. And keep in mind that just because a plants prefers sun doesn't mean it can handle the heat summer usually brings. This is often true for plants that grow naturally in cooler climates, such as in high altitudes or in coastal areas. Some plants have markers that indicate they grow easily or self-sow, these are great plants to start with.</p><p><b>Wildlife:</b> Impact of wildlife and insects on plant. We have lots of deer as well as chipmunks, rabbits and birds that live nearby. I try to grow enough food for everyone, but I can't let them eat everything! I have some fenced areas for sensitive plants I don't want being bothered. I try to be as hands-off as possible and rarely remove insects from plants or interfere with their growth. </p><p><b>Notes: </b>Everything else. Observations about growth habits, useful varieties, hardiness, harvesting, interactions with other plants and more. Plants with photos were grown in Maryland, roughly zone 7a. You may notice some of the plants in my photos don't look perfectly healthy - this is okay. If it is a perennial, as long as it has a healthy root system it will grow just fine after being planted and given a few seasons to adjust. </p><p><u>Conditions:</u> The conditions are fairly wet year round, although in the summer there are stretches where the soil dries out. Soil is good overall, some spots with heavy clay and some very sandy. Normally the only time I water plants is while they are getting established. Most non-perennial plants survive (or die) exclusively on rain water, unless they are lucky enough to be near a perennial I'm watering.</p><p><u>Storage:</u> My ideal form of storage for root crops is none at all - allowing the plant to remain in the ground until it is ready to be eaten. I don't have any great storage space either, so everything brought indoors must be cleaned to prevent bugs from hitching a ride. This is a considerable amount of work to do all at once depending on the plant and something I like to avoid if I can. Regarding annual root crops, I also actively select for plants that can stay alive as long as possible so I don't need to worry about harvesting and storing them. Instead I can keep them 'stored' in the ground until ready for use (just like how I 'store' my seeds). As a general rule, if they must be harvested they should be kept in a cool, dark environment with some humidity and airflow. Many non-cold-hardy roots don't like to remain dormant for long, so it may be useful to have some form of covered unit or greenhouse to keep them alive during winter. Grains are particularly easy to store and should be kept dry but require no special conditions. Leafy vegetables can be wrapped in a cloth or bag and stored in the refrigerator or freezer.</p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><h2>Herbs</h2><p><br></p><h3>Agastache Rugosa 'Korean Mint' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf, flower.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.

Bunnies nibble on leaves. Leaves fed to many animals, may be mildly toxic.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: B. oleracea</b> consists of many different plants including broccoli, cabbage, kale and cauliflower - almost all of which are annuals and biennials. Of these I tend to focus on kale because this particular variety of kale is known to have some perennial forms. Most kale will set seed after their first winter, but some forms will either set seed after 2-3 years of growth or never/rarely set seed at all. Those that don't set seed are usually propagated by stem cutting. Stem cuttings can be placed in moist soil to root and clone the original plant.</p><p>I am particularly interested in the forms that can live for a few years before setting seed. This not only ensures genetic diversity but also opens up the possibility of harvesting the inflorescence and perhaps breeding some form of a short-lived perennial kale/broccoli vegetable.</p><p>Of the flowering forms I have noticed that some are able to continue growing, albeit in a very stunted way, even after flowering and without being pruned. This makes me wonder about the potential for a polycarpic perennial kale (flowering more than once). To the best of my knowledge this does not yet exist. So I do see a lot of potential in these weird forms as well.</p><p>Most of the plants also generate a lot of seed, so in my garden I generally toss the pods around the beds, see what comes up, see how many of them flower after the first winter, see how many of those are able to continue growing, keep track of the specimens that appear to be perennial, and just generally try to select for interesting specimens as they come up. </p><p>Like others in this genus it is very susceptible to insects.

The main stem even gets woody after just one growing season. Unfortunately it will not survive outdoors in my climate, but there is potential to grow it in a greenhouse or to bring it indoors over winter. I tried bringing a few indoors for winter but after cleaning and trimming they did not survive, perhaps I brought them in too late. Even so this is still a fun plant to grow. If growing as a perennial the yields are better as the plant gets older. If growing as an annual, start it indoors as early as possible so the fruits have enough time to ripen before frost. They take their time with this so you have to be prepared. The fruits are relatively large and the seeds are black, unlike other peppers.</p><p><b>C. flexuosum</b> is another species that fascinates me, mostly because it is the hardiest species within the genus.

But cardoon is much hardier and therefore the only perennial option in colder climates. The flower head and bracts of cardoon can still be eaten but they are not as fleshy and so offer a less worthwhile harvest. The main harvest from cardoon is the thick leaf stalks.</p><p>Theoretically, cardoon should be an obvious selection for any garden where it will grow. The plant does not need great soil and can grow in sun or part shade. It effectively blocks out nearby competition with its large leaves and creates a significant amount of biomass for mulching. Mature plants produce a sizeable harvest as well. The only catch is that the leaf stalks can be quite unpalatable straight off the plant. This is why they are usually blanched by wrapping some sort of paper or cloth around the leaves. And even then they should be peeled, chopped and thoroughly boiled. So a wonderful vegetable to grow but may be a hassle to prepare. </p><p>Some varieties of cardoon have spines, but I would avoid these and instead opt for those without.

And it's not like dandelion or some other weeds because this is one you actually want to eat and one that is cultivated as a vegetable in China. The flowers are some of the best out there being sweet and delicious, even when raw. </p><p>The flowers can be eaten as buds or fully opened. They are cooked, dried, pickled or sometimes eaten raw. The shoots are also eaten as a vegetable, but the leaves quickly get tough if left to grow. The roots are less commonly eaten. Most online resources indicate any species is fine to eat, whether its the flowers, shoots or roots. But not every species has a recorded history of being eaten, and those that do often do not include all three parts of the plant.</p><p>It seems the roots in particular are seldom or never eaten depending on the species.<i> Edible Wild Plants Of Vietnam</i> indicates at least one species used for edible flowers has mildly poisonous roots. Granted this book isn't the most reliable but it's worth noting. <i>The Encyclopedia Of Edible Plants Of North America </i>mentions the roots of some species are eaten<i> </i>but <i>Food Plants Of</i> <i>China</i> makes no mention of it for any of the species it lists. Both<i> Plants For Human Consumption</i> and <i>Cornucopia </i>only list some of the species as having an edible root. Many are listed as being eaten only for the shoots and flowers. Let us remember one of our basic principles - just because one species in a genus is edible in a certain way does not mean others are! </p><p>My recommendation is to stick to the species with a history of being eaten and not to bother with the roots. Along with this yellow flowering species eaten in Japan, this includes <b>H. fulva </b>(common orange ditch lily)<b> </b>and <b>H. lilioasphodelus/H. flava </b>(shorter plant with sweet-scented, yellow flowers).

I would suggest sticking with the well-documented species or doing your own research for the specific species you are interested in. This species is a standard in Japan and the normal recommendation. </p><p>It is primarily the shoots, young leaves and petioles that are eaten. Most English sources do not mention the petioles but they appear in Japanese reference books more frequently. They are a good way to extend the harvest of the plant once the leaves become too big and tough. The flowers are sometimes a very minor crop as well, however <i>Food Plants Of China </i>indicates the flowers of <b>H. plantaginea</b> require cooking to detoxify them. Therefore do not assume they are safe raw for any species without evidence to the contrary (despite what you may read online). </p><p>The fact that hostas can tolerate full sun or deep shade makes them very fun to have in the garden. I can have other plants growing right next to them and they don't mind the shade it creates at all. They can act as a sort of groundcover in that way and still provide a high quality vegetable.</p><p>Will tolerate most conditions as long as the soil is not overly dry. Useful for deep shade where edible options are limited. Although the deer love it, there shouldn't be a problem harvesting the shoots as they typically only eat it later on in the growth cycle. That being said, if a small plant is continually eaten to the ground then it may simply die.

Entire plant toxic to many animals.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>One of the most beloved vegetables in my garden, and certainly one of the most opportunistic. Considered an escaped weed in many areas but a very old Korean vegetable that has been relied on for centuries. This plant is also the perfect example of one of the paradoxes most gardeners confront - vegetables that are too easy to grow are seen as weeds, and vegetables that are more difficult to grow just make life harder for us! Why not embrace the weedy vegetables? Why make life harder than it is? If you plant these out of the way and make sure their seeds don't get spread around it's no problem at all. </p><p>It grows enthusiastically and can tolerate shade and dry soil fairly well (it does need water but don't believe online sources that say it needs consistently moist soil). Many forms are quite bushy and can get over 5 feet high with tons of fragrant leaves! Red varieties are used mare as a garnish while green varieties are used more as a vegetable or for kimchi. Young and tender flowering shoots are edible whole, while flowers/buds can be picked off older shoots. <b>P. frutescens var. crispa </b>is the Japanese variety often called shiso, and <b>P. frutescens var. frutescens </b>is the korean variety<b> </b>often called perilla, although the names are sometimes used interchangeably. </p><p>The 38N Kkaennip variety has done exceptionally well for me after just tossing the seeds around the beds. This variety is wonderful and a standard. A bit tougher than other varieties but it makes up for that in how well it grows. This variety also sometimes 'catches' the flowers that fall off on the leaves below - these can be collected and used as a garnish. Green Ao is a nice Japanese variety, a bit softer and better for eating raw, but not nearly as vigorous. This one flowers and dies earlier too.</p><p>Many varieties can get quite big (even to 5 feet tall) and shade out nearby plants, so this is another reason to keep it out of the way. It is easy to imagine filling large areas with this plant in just a season or two. Big specimens will also produce a surprisingly thick and woody stem. This sort of carbon generation combined with its vigorous growth and ability to shade out weeds makes me think it could have a place in soil regeneration. As long as it can be controlled and easily removed for succession. Overall an extremely valuable plant.</p><p><u>Suggested Varieties:</u> '38N Kkaennip' from <a href="https://www.kitazawaseed.com/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kitazawa Seed</a>.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/6k6uucpjpnl4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">P. frutescens.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Petasites Japonicus 'Japanese Butterbur' 'フキ' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf petiole, leaf, inflorescence.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division, seed.

Once established it spread quickly by rhizome, sending up giant leaves on tall stalks that will quickly overtake any shady and wet area. Because of that it is very useful for wet and shady areas where few other edible plants will grow. Prefers very little direct sun if any but will tolerate some heat. Plant it in a spot where it can be easily managed and will not escape.</p><p>The entire plant has toxic alkaloids and should be eaten in moderation after preparing according to traditional methods. The stems are the most common harvest, and should always be peeled after cooking.<i> A Dictionary Of Japanese Food</i> seems to indicate even the mature stems can be eaten, but the younger ones are tastier and probably safer. Young leaves (roughly hand sized or smaller) are also eaten after cooking. The unopened flower head is a prefered traditional vegetable, although few English references mention this. These are called fukinoto.</p><p><b>P. japonicus var. giganteus</b> is a larger variety edible in the same way, growing taller with larger leaves. <i>Useful Plants Of Japan, Described And Illustrated </i>writes that this larger variety is inferior in taste. There is a slo a purple-tinted variety. Related to <b>P. frigidus</b>, arctic butterbur, which is used for the young flowering shoots.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/ocuiajhfde87" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">P. japonicus.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Peucedanum Japonicum 'Coastal Hog Fennel' 'ボタンボウフウ' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Shoot, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed. </p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>An undiscovered vegetable in the west and rarely eaten even in Japan.

The taste right out of the garden is surprisingly palatable with crisp and succulent leaves (although it should be cooked before eating). The plant naturally grows on coasts with sandy or rocky soil, being regularly exposed to saline water and air. The fat root helps anchor it to cliffs with eroding soil. All this adds up to make it very resilient, exactly what we're looking for. In standard garden conditions it grows without any problems and seems to do fine even in moderate shade.

Tall stalks, very large leaves and just as easy to grow as the rest. Edible in exactly the same way as well, but with a stronger taste. Some, if not all, of the species in this genus grow quickly in poor soil and have deep, extensive root systems.

Excellent medicinal for soar throat or coughs.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/vnnbnrtae2fh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A. officinalis.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Apios Americana 'Groundnut' | Perennial 🖤 </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Tuber, seedpod.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun.

Naturally more of a woodland plant so it is adapted to some shade, but I find they don't do particularly well in shade. They already grow slowly enough as it is, so the more sun they can get the better. The tubers form along long rhizomes, and the plant does best with something to climb on, although it can be allowed to sprawl. Take care when weeding so as not to yank any plants that the vine has attached itself to. Perennial, vining, cold hardy root crops are rare so this serves an interesting niche in that regard. It also fixes nitrogen but since the root is the part harvested I am unsure if it would benefit the soil as much as other nitrogen fixers.</p><p>Wild varieties can be very small compared to improved varieties coming out of some breeding programs, so make sure to order an improved variety. Best on a 2-3 year rotation like other perennial roots. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/lhp9badujuf1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A. americana.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Arctium Lappa 'Burdock' | Biennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">CALORIE CROP</b></p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to part shade.

Root and leaves fed to many animals, may be mildly toxic.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Turnips are light feeders, so they don't need great soil to flourish. I like to think of them as being more efficient producers of food because of this - many more popular vegetables need lots of nutrients, but turnips can create the same amount of food with a lot less. So you get more mileage from your soil with them, at least that's my thought process. This is probably one of the reasons they used to be a lot more common, before fertilizer was so readily available. </p><p>Of all the species in the Brassica genus, I think turnips show the most potential. They can be eaten for their leaves or flowering shoots, just like the others. In fact, they are often just as good as the others in this regard. But they also have a root! So not only do they do what the others do, they also provide a great source of energy in the form of a taproot on top of that. This is great for two reasons. One, it is an additional, calorie-dense harvest. Two, it is a wonderful way to feed the soil. So even if you don't care about the root, you can harvest the leaves and let the root die, aerating and feeding the soil! Just like other taproots, if you filled a bed with turnips and then let them die in the soil, the improvements would be massive in just a single season. But none of the other taprooted plants create such high quality leaves, and very few of them grow as easily as the turnip. </p><p>I think there is potential to use turnips as the foundation for breeding a super-mustard. In my imagination this is a mustard that makes a fat taproot, produces an abundance of mild leaves and tender flowering shoots, and only sets seed after overwintering. Now that would be nice, right?</p><p>They seem more resilient than other mustards, especially for summer-growth. Plus they are more likely to overwinter than radishes. I am selecting for cold hardiness so they can grow year round and produce seed after winter. Overwintered plants also produce a significant amount of greens in spring. Used to pelt ancient roman governors, not just a nutritious food but also a revolutionary weapon! Let best plants go to seed, harvest others before flowering. </p><p><u>Suggested Varieties:</u> 'Scarlet Ohno Revival' from <a href="https://www.wildgardenseed.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wild Garden Seed</a>.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/p7btvhcbsree" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">B. rapa.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Campanula Rapunculus 'Rampion' | Biennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Not to be confused with <b>C rapunculoides</b>, a perennial eaten in the same way but considered an aggressive weed and probably best left out of the garden. <b>C. latifolia </b>should be a better perennial alternative. </p><p><br></p><h3>Canna Edulis 'Achira' | Annual 🖤</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Rhizome, shoot. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">CALORIE CROP</b></p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">SOIL REGENERATION</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant?

First off, this plant is very easy to grow. Despite the tropical appearance it will produce even in temperate climates with relatively short growing seasons. It needs mostly sun but is not picky about soil and does just fine surviving off rainwater in my garden, with periods where the soil dries out. Many references indicate it needs consistently moist soil - this will improve yields but it is absolutely not essential. These plants are resilient.</p><p>Second, not only is it gorgeous but it makes an incredible amount of high quality biomass. The leaves are thick and the stalks are chunky. This is an amazing mulch plant and I would grow it just for this purpose even if it also did not produce an edible root! Excellent for soil regeneration.</p><p>Finally, this plant is productive. It requires the entire growing season, but expect yields of at least 5 or 6 pounds per plant in non-optimal conditions. With the right soil, water and sun you will get even more out of it. That is insanely productive and this is one of the highest calorie-producing roots for temperate climates. This plant is a perennial in roughly Z7 and above. When grown as a perennial the young root can be harvested by slicing it with a shovel and leaving the rest in the ground. Heavy winds may bend or rip some leaves but this is never much of a problem. </p><p>One of the main drawbacks of this plant is that flowers rarely form, and even then they rarely produce seed. There are also very few clones available. And on top of that there are multiple viruses that are extremely common, so much so that nurseries often ship infected plants. These then easily spread the virus to other nearby plants. The only way to get around this would be to start a new plant from seed, but these rarely produce any. This is, in my eyes, the main issue with this plant. But viruses don't stop people from growing potatoes!</p><p>Can be eaten raw but usually cooked. The easiest way to prepare the roots is to bake with the skin attached. Bake thoroughly until the the inside is completely soft. Then peal off the skin before eating. It is somewhat neutral in flavor but slightly sweet. I have no doubt it could be made into a perfectly appetizing dish. </p><p><b>C. indica</b> can be grown and used the same way but there is no reason to do this because the yields are much lower. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/q2oloee4saj8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. edulis.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Chaerophyllum Bulbosum 'Root Chervil' | Biennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.

Once could spend an entire lifetime learning how to grow this sacred plant, and many still do. Unfortunately here in the states most varieties are purely ornamental and it's difficult to find anything besides the most common edible varieties. And these edible varieties are often eaten in different ways, so it's important to understand how each specific variety is prepared. Some are grown for the main corm, some for the dormant cormells, some for the stems or young leaves.

Most do not reliably overwinter below Z8. The more water they have the better, but they are fine with normal garden conditions as well. Many are under the impression taro can only be grown in tropical climates, but this isn't true. It will still produce in temperate climates if you have the right variety!</p><p>Corms are formed continuously as the plants grows, so even if it doesn't grow very long you will still get something out of it. If not for eating at least to replant next season. </p><p><b>C. gigantea</b> is a little-known relative of taro called Bac Ha but is certainly worthy of more widespread cultivation, especially in permaculture circles. This species is a reliable perennial in my garden and likely hardy to Z6. It grows much larger than taro, older specimens growing over 6 feet high! The leaves are also huge and magnificent, hence the common name giant taro. The plant spread by stolons (corms are not typically formed from what I can tell), so patches will quickly appear. It prefers conditions similar to taro but is tougher and more resilient than taro. Wet soil will help it grow better. Will tolerate fairly deep shade.</p><p>Unfortunately only the leaf stems are eaten, so it provides far less food than taro does. Still, the leaf stems are a unique and delicious vegetable, something like spongy celery, often used in soups. Many references indicate they need to be peeled, but I personally do not peel the young and tender stems. They should be cooked as far as I'm aware.</p><p>There are also ornamental clones of this species such as 'Thailand Giant' or similar ones sold in many nurseries. Do not eat any part of these. They are not the same. The common variety used for food can be found on ebay or etsy.</p><p>Given how big this plant is it makes for a good mulch plant as well. The frustrating thing about this plant is that it only sprouts in late June. So the growing season is short and by this point the rains have become less common, meaning drier soil and slower growth.</p><p>Plants in this genus are very closely related to those in the Alocasia genus, some of which are used as food as well. Bac Ha is often incorrectly identified as coming from this genus (even in a reference book I have). I don't think any Alocasia species are cultivated for food in temperate climates.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/ucu1cic20gcn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. esculenta.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/qln6efh76csm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">C. gigantea.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Crepidiastrum Sonchifolium 'Goddeulbbaegi' '고들빼기' | Biennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Notes: </b></p><p><br></p><h3>Curcuma Longa 'Turmeric' | Annual</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Rhizome, shoot.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division.

Another plant that people associate with tropical climates yet are sufficiently productive when grown as annuals in temperate climates. This species only get a few feet tall and just by the looks of it, you wouldn't expect to get much out of it. But as soon as the plant starts growing, the rhizome starts expanding. I was surprised by how quickly the rhizome grew, even when the plants were getting sunburnt from the summer heat. Rich soil with shelter from heat is best, especially when growing as a perennial. But letting it get a bit burnt can be worth the higher yield resulting from full sun.</p><p><b>C. amada</b>, mango ginger, grows much taller and has a sweeter mango flavor. Just as productive.

I mean wow, like a totally different vegetable! I try to incorporate as many taprooted plants in my garden as I can because they help improve the soil when allowed to go to seed. Just like radishes and turnips, carrots offer the same benefits. In my experience, carrots have been a bit harder to really incorporate because so many of them end up dying in natural conditions. Many seem to rot easily and they do seem a bit pickier than both radishes and turnips. But with the right cold-hardy varieties and persistent selection, I think they will do just fine. Cold hardiness is essential so they can be left in the ground over winter in order to produce seed the following spring. </p><p>Despite their sensitivities, they do have a few qualities I really enjoy. The seedlings seem to pick up speed very quickly and shoot right past whatever mulch or ground covers are nearby. This quick vertical growth helps ensure they don't get shaded out while still very young. They also store well and make for an a excellent staple crop.</p><p>The carrot family is full of poisonous lookalikes, so always be sure of your identification.

The tuber extends very deep into the earth, often over a foot long, and sends up a climbing vine with beautiful, heart-shapes leaves. When the plant is old enough, small aerial tubers form at the leaf nodes. These fall to the ground after the leaves die back, and sprout to become new plants. So the aerial tubers are edible in exactly the same way as the main tuber. They do spread very easily and can become invasive, so be sure to contain them. </p><p>The root is usually harvested after 2-3 years. It is very fragile and cannot be pulled out of the ground, so without any soil preparation beforehand it would have to be excavated. Because of this, many people plant them in grow bags or containers, or even in plastic drainage pipes buried in the ground. A trellis is also necessary to provide something for the vine to climb on. Aerial tubers sometimes take a few weeks (or longer) to sprout roots, so get them ready early.</p><p>The naming of this species is something of a mess. It is sometimes referred to as <b>D. polystachya</b>, although whether they are truly the same species or not is unclear. The older name is <b>D. opposita</b>.</p><p>The book <i>Ethnobotany and Useful Resource Plants of Dokdo and Ulleung Island in Korea</i> indicates that the young leaves and tender new growth of this particular species can be eaten after being cooked. I was a bit skeptical having never seen this references anywhere else, but the creator of <a href="https://sesamesprinkles.home.blog/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sesame Sprinkles</a> confirmed that korean recipes that make use of the leaves do in fact exist. She informed me they are usually pickled in soy sauce (마잎장아찌). I later learned that Korean reference books almost always mention the young leaves as being edible too.

I am currently experimenting with a planting pattern that allows the potatoes to stay in the ground until frost at which point I will harvest most of them and immediately replant the remaining as seed potatoes. The potatoes would then sit in the ground over winter and sprout the following spring. This pattern allows me to grow other crops that need the entire growing season alongside the potatoes. It also limits the soil disturbance to once per season. However the longer potatoes are kept in the ground, the greater the chance they will succumb to disease, insects or rot. So finding the right variety for this method will be essential.

The seedlings start out very small but once they get going they don't stop! These plants produce tons of edible leaves and a giant inflorescence packed with dense, shiny seeds. I prefer this plant over other seed options for a few reasons. First, it's very easy to harvest. The plants are big and each contains a huge amount of seeds, so you get way more of a harvest per plant compared to something like barley. Second, the seeds don't need any husking or processing aside from separating the chaff out. They are pretty much good to go right off the plant. And finally, along with a generous amount of seed, the plant produces huge stalks that make top notch mulch. We are feeding ourselves and the soil at the same time.</p><p>I have tried growing some plants a bit more naturally, tossing their seeds around the beds and seeing how well they do. Generally they do very poorly, germinating late and growing quite small. The seedlings seem to be a bit too wimpy to handle competition well. But even when small they still go on to produce some seed which is nice. And they are quite beautiful anyway.</p><p>There are varieties grown for seed and those grown for leaves. Varieties grown for their seed have edible leaves too. Varieties grown for their leaves do not make good seed for eating but the leaves are much more tender and palatable. </p><p>This species is a standard for seed production. <b>A. tricolor</b> is another species I grow for leaf production. It branches out nicely and has beautiful multi-colored leaves.

Putting aside the minor use as a vegetable (with protein rich leaves to boot), this plant has incredible potential for soil regeneration. I planted these directly into compacted soil covered in grass, did not provide any irrigation in addition to what the rain offered them, and many still grew beautifully. This is a very special quality. The stems can grow to be as thick as amaranth stems and make absolutely perfect mulch. All this makes it an excellent choice for quickly regenerating poor soil.</p><p>The plants are quite tall and therefore make a natural companion for vining edibles. If they are not planted densely they are more likely to bend over from the wind, but few of them seem to break. And because the leaves are relatively small and stay close to the stalk, this plant creates very little shade. </p><p>Kenaf varieties are generally categorized by how quickly they flower, although I do not pretend to understand the nuances of that scheme. But the general tradeoff is that earlier flowering types are less productive and grow to be shorter plants. When direct seeded in the conditions I described above, only one of the plants flowered early enough to produce viable seed before frost.

So I try to make use of them when I can, but keep in mind that once they get to be a few feet tall they can be a pain to get rid of.</p><p>I do not have the ability to grow such a huge tree in my backyard so I have instead opted for a dwarf variety, of which there are plenty to choose from. They still grow quickly and easily, they still bear heavily, but many grow less than 10 feet tall making them easy to manage. <a href="https://ediblelandscaping.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Edible Landscaping</a> has the best selection. I am growing the Japanese variety 'Issai'. </p><p>There is a common black-fruiting tree called 'Dwarf Everbearing' that is not actually a dwarf tree, do not believe what you read online. The amount of websites and nurseries that claim this plant is a dwarf tree is just astounding. I believe what you are actually buying is a repackaged 'Illinois Everbearing' tree that grows to 30+ feet. It can be kept short and still produce fruit but that means you will have to heavily prune it (read: massacre it) every year.</p><p><b>M. alba</b> is the white mulberry and <b>M. rubra</b> is the red mulberry.

It has a perennial root system that send up new canes every year, which fruit their second year before dying. There are also everbearing varieties with canes that fruit twice before dying. Many are thornless and I prefer those just because they are easier to manage, but the thorned varieties tend to be more vigorous. </p><p>The thimbleberry, <b>R. parviflorus</b>, barely fruits at all but doesn't have any thorns, grows taller and the canes don't die back. The Japanese wineberry, <b>R. phoenicolasius</b>, is an extremely thorny scrambling bush although it can be trellised. <b>R. fruticosus</b> is the blackberry, another vigorous choice. Of all the cane types in this genus I think thornless raspberries are the easiest to manage. </p><p>There are also groundcovers with modest fruiting like <b>R. calycinoides</b>, the Taiwanese creeping raspberry. It is small and not the most productive crop but covers ground well and grows very easily.

And because it has such tenacious qualities, I am exploring the possibility of planting fruit or vegetable vines nearby which can then use the tree as a trellis. I think this may work well.</p><p>This particular species grows wild in my area but there are many others. Unfortunately it is not generally regarded as safe to eat the raw berries more than a few at a time.

Grows as a die-back vine, likes to clamber or climb, and tips can root when touching the soil.</p><p>I think this plant has amazing potential for the forest garden because in temperate climates there is absolutely nothing else like it. It also tolerates fairly deep shade and is low maintenance. There are, however, a few difficulties. First, the seeds do not germinate easily. They should be soaked and scarified but even then it's not a sure bet. In the ground they may take months or over a year to germinate. You will also need both a male and female plant to produce fruit. So that means you'll have to grow out at least 3 seedlings to have a good chance.

The fruits can be eaten fresh while the pads must be cooked. Incredibly resilient, carefree and an underutilized vegetable here in the sates. </p><p>When considering this plant, it is important to understand the difference between spines and glochids. Most forms have spines, these are the large and sharp needles that stab you. Some forms are spineless, and these are what I prefer to cultivate as it makes my life easier and they are less dangerous in the garden. However, I am not aware of any forms for any species that do not have any glochids. Glochids are invisible barbed hairs that are found all over the pads and fruit. Touching them can be mildly painful although they are usually easy to pull out if it's only a few. Because of this, even if the form is spineless it is still not safe to touch the cactus. Use gloves or preferably tongs when handling cacti in this genus. After harvesting, thoroughly wash and scrub every inch of the cactus or fruit to remove the glochids. You can also burn them off if you have the right equipment.</p><p>This species is a standard in cultivation. It survives the cold by releasing some of the water stored in its pads before freezing weather arrives. The pads become shriveled, preventing them from freezing. This is healthy and they will perk back up come spring time. <b>O. cacanapa</b> has larger pads, doesn't shrivel and is less cold hardy.

This species is said to be used on the skin and I believe the original source for this is <i>The Aloes Of South Africa</i>:</p><blockquote>Mr. Frank Brownlee, Magistrate at Mount Ayliff, East Griqualand, in March 1925, records (in litt.): "It is an interesting fact that the juice of this plant mixed with water is sometimes used by the natives for washing their bodies. The washing is said to have a tonic and refreshing effect on the system."</blockquote><p>It is diluted in water before application but in what ratio I do not know. Unfortunately I have not found any other sources that discuss the medicinal application of this species outside of research papers that are only analyzing certain compounds within the plant. These, of course, cannot be used to deduce the safeness of the plant as a whole. </p><p>But given that this species is potentially very cold hardy and may have similar effects to common aloe (although applied differently), I believe it is worth more research. It could be a local, sustainable source of natural skin moisturizer. When my plants are big enough I will try using it and report back.</p><p><b>A. vera</b> is the standard and is easily grown indoors. The leaf gel of this more common species can be eaten (although bitter when raw) or used on skin for wounds, burns or simply as a moisturizer. </p><p><br></p><h3>Gentiana Tibetica 'Tibetan Gentian' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Medicinal: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Beautiful plants, the roots of which are the gold standard for bitter digestives. <b>G. lutea</b> is used similarly although has preformed much worse for me. I would therefore suggest the tibetan species. </p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/nfino21mehh4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gentiana spp.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Panax Quinquefolius 'American Ginseng' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Medicinal: </b>Root, leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division, seed. May be difficult from seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Deep shade to shade. Woodland.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> None.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>One of the most sought after and expensive native American medicinals. Roots take years to form into a good size for harvesting. Good plant for shady understory, can be interplanted with ramps and wild ginger. Roots will give you a quicker start.</p><p><br></p><h3>Peperomia Congona 'Congona' | Indoor Perennial </h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Stem, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Potted.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>A houseplant for me but I love it so much that I wanted to include it. And it is certainly worthy of more cultivation not only for its medicinal properties but also for the wonderful flavor! The leaves of this Peruvian plant can be used as a spice or garnish and taste like licorice-citrus-mint-pepper-refreshing-zesty. Hard to describe but wonderful. Chewing the leaves is also said to be good for oral hygiene. Cut stems root easily in water.</p><p><b>P. peruviana</b> is also chewed for oral hygene but is slow growing. It grows in the crevices of rock walls. In an attempt to imitate these conditions, I have mine potted in akadema, sphagnum moss, and worm castings. It seems to be doing alright. I also grow <b>P. inaequalifolia</b>, a much smaller plant than congona but with an excellent sweet citrus taste as well. This one prefers well-draining succulent culture. All are grown indoors. Many others in this genus are important medicinals as well.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/1elbumr7l7ts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">P. congona.</a> <a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/jvc2cpmlp8s6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">P. inaequalifolia.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Prunella Vulgaris 'Self Heal' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Edible: </b>Leaf.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to part shade. Woodland.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive?</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Something of a medicinal pancea and and one of my favorite groundcovers for shade. The leaves can be eaten (probably best in small quantities) which makes it easier to use. They aren't particularly tasty but I can imagine throwing a few into soup just as an easy way to get your medicine. Surprisingly tolerant of dry soil. Gorgeous flowers.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/q0ecsqh1kfs8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">P. vulgaris.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Silene Capensis 'Xhosa Dream Root' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Medicinal: </b>Root.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division, seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun.</p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>As a casual lucid dreamer myself I am interested in experimenting with this plant.

Bunnies love it.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>An easy way to plant a living mulch and fix nitrogen. <b>T. repens</b> is more common, a slightly smaller perennial with white flowers. <b>T. incarnatum</b> is the crimson species, a tall and showy annual with red flowers. They all work well as nitrogen-fixing groundcovers. Which one to grow depends on whether you want an annual or perennial. The perennial species are great for meadows or fields. A patch of clover will attract bunnies, they often leave droppings so I consider it a very worthwhile trade! </p><p><br></p><h3>Musa Basjoo 'Japanese Banana' | Perennial </h3><p><b>Support: </b>Mulch, shade.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Division.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Shade to sun. </p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer resistant.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>This is the hardiest species of banana, down to at least Z7 (lower with mulch). It doesn't produce edible fruit but I think it has excellent potential for generating mulch. The leaves are huge and the plant can grow 15 feet tall when fully mature. Banana leaves and stems will also break down slower than those of other herbacious plants. </p><p>Best in a spot sheltered from wind as heavy gusts can tear the leaves and bend the top down. There are some growing in an open spot in my neighborhood and every year they look absolutely terrible after the first heavy winds. Seems to appreciate shelter from heat and will do fine in moderate shade.</p><p><b>Photos: </b><a href="https://www.jottacloud.com/share/l0murp2ml90g" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">M. basjoo.</a></p><p><br></p><h3>Paulownia Tomentosa 'Empress Tree' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Support: </b>Mulch, shade.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">EASY &amp; VIGOROUS</b> <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">SOIL REGENERATION</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>One of the fastest growing trees in temperate climates. It can grow over 10 feet in a single season, providing large leaves and wood for mulching. When fully mature the tree gets very tall so for me it is easiest to manage when cut back to the ground every fall. There are a few different varieties to choose from if you're looking to grow it from seed.</p><p><br></p><h3>Symphytum Uplandicum 'Comfrey' | Perennial</h3><p><b>Support: </b>Mulch, shade.</p><p><b>Propagation:</b> Seed.</p><p><b>Conditions:</b> Part shade to sun. <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">EASY &amp; VIGOROUS</b> <b style="background-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); font-size: 13px;">SOIL REGENERATION</b></p><p><b>Wildlife</b>: Deer sensitive? Leaves fed to many animals.</p><p><b>Status:</b> Established.</p><p><b>Notes: </b>Comfrey is a low-growing plant that forms mounds of big fuzzy leaves. The real wonder of this plant is its deep roots which help cycle nutrients from lower down in the ground back to the topsoil when the leaves are mulched. Many varieties produce fertile seed and are known to spread aggressively. However 'Bocking 14' is a sterile variety and for that reason is quite common. I grow this one right by my compost pile, the idea being that its roots will catch some of the nutrients draining off into the soil. Because this variety is sterile is must be transplanted, by root fragment or preferably crown. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p><p><i>If you would learn to be subservient to the king you would not have to live on lentils.</i></p><p><i>-Aristippus</i></p><p><i>If you would learn to live on lentils you would not have to be subservient to the king.</i></p><p><i>-Diogenes</i></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>Sanctuary Gardens</h2><p>Garden design for animal sanctuaries to help feed residents (human + non-human) and enrich the local ecosystem.

in existence those causes which imperatively demand, and will always demand so long as they exist, the intervention of just such restrictive governments as we now have. </i></p><p><i>-Stephen Pearl Andrews</i></p><p><br></p><hr><h2><br></h2><h2>About Me</h2><p>Hi! My name is Noah and I wrote everything here. After confronting the horrifying reality of climate collapse and the ongoing animal holocaust, I wanted to understand what it meant to live compassionately and sustainably. What does an environment that can care for all of the creatures within it look like? How can I work towards that? To me, this is everything.</p><p>I think plants are the foundation of any possible answer to this question, and this page is exactly what I wish I had when I started my research. There are so many plants that could completely transform how we feed ourselves and how we live. I don't like to focus on solutions that require major landscaping efforts - most of us are working by ourselves, on a small plot of land with limited equipment. I think this approach is a bit more practical, especially in the face of a civilization that is rapidly deteriorating. The worst famines humanity has ever seen are on the horizon and there is no better time to start building resiliant food systems.</p><p>If you'd like to get in touch with me, I am available at noahzwill[@]gmail.com. I'm happy to discuss anything and love to learn from others. If there are any seeds or plants you are looking for, I may be able to point you in the right direction. </p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>
